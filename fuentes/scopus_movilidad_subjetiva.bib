	abstract = {Extensive research explores the relationship between deepening conflict over socio-cultural issues and stagnating social mobility, typically focusing on men. Upwardly mobile women are routinely mentioned as belonging to the progressive “winners” of the knowledge-based society, yet their experiences and politics have received far less attention. This paper theorizes and investigates how women view their individual and collective trajectories and how these views relate to perceptions of future opportunities and political attitudes. Using survey data from four West European countries, we find that, while experiencing upward intergenerational mobility at the individual level is associated with positive opportunity perceptions, this relationship is not more pronounced among women than men nor linked to especially progressive attitudes. Rather, it is women sharing a sense of upward collective momentum who demand further action to achieve gender equality. This contrasts with men—including those perceiving themselves as upwardly mobile—who also acknowledge women’s collective gains: they more readily accept the still male-dominated status quo. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have primarily concentrated on the disparities in health and well-being based on objective measures of social mobility across various countries with conflicting views. Recent focus and debate have been directed toward the subjective dimension of social mobility. Beyond the conventional focus on intergenerational and intragenerational mobility, I incorporate a third form of prospective mobility while differentiating between their upward and downward trajectories as well as varying degrees of change in social status. This study analyzes subjective perceptions of social mobility by different forms, directions, and distances in contemporary China and investigates their relationships with health outcomes and happiness. Using pooled data from eight waves of the Chinese General Social Survey, this study employs multiple scales to assess perceived social mobility, distinguishing it from previous research that typically depends on a singular survey question. Results support the theories of “Falling from Grace” and “Rising from Rags” on the role of intergenerational mobility on health and happiness, as well as the influence of prospective mobility on health alone. However, the detrimental impacts of intragenerational upward and downward mobility on health are consistent with the dissociative thesis. The findings on varying degrees of mobility among the three forms of perceived social mobility further shed light on the significance of distance in connection to mobility. The findings also advance the state of knowledge in intergenerational mobility by comparing its effect with that of intragenerational and prospective mobility on health and happiness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Methods: We recruited 286 Chinese adults (Study 1) and 448 Chinese adolescents (Study 2) to examine the relationship between PEI and envy, the mediating effects of a zero-sum mindset and perceived social mobility, and the moderating effect of socioeconomic status (SES). Results: In both adults and adolescents, PEI was positively associated with malicious envy across SES backgrounds, while its relationship with benign envy varied by SES. A zero-sum mindset mediated the linkages between PEI and both forms of envy in adults, whereas, in adolescents, it solely mediated the relationship between PEI and malicious envy. Unexpectedly, subjective social mobility was positively associated with PEI across age groups and exerted a suppressing effect on the relationship between PEI and both forms of envy in adolescents, fostering benign envy and suppressing malicious envy. Conclusion: These findings highlight the diverse strategies for economic inequality across SES groups and explicate the role of the zero-sum mindset in exacerbating malicious envy and subjective social mobility in promoting benign envy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We investigated whether adolescents endorsed caste essentialist beliefs and whether these beliefs about the stability of caste correlate with their perceived social mobility and social location (caste, SES). We interviewed 590 students between the ages of 10 and 18 years (M<inf>age</inf> = 14 years; SD<inf>age</inf> = 1 year 7 months) of grades 6–10 from 25 school classes in Nepal to assess their caste essentialist beliefs with a switched-at-birth task and measured their perceived social mobility in terms of perceived feasibility regarding marriage to a higher caste. In line with our assumptions, adolescents of the highest caste group showed stronger essentialist beliefs regarding both higher and lower caste when compared to adolescents from the other caste groups and believed that an individual's caste would not change even when switched at birth. Adolescents of the highest caste and from higher-SES backgrounds expressed stronger essentialist beliefs than their peers. Caste essentialist beliefs and perceived feasibility regarding marriage to a higher caste were significantly correlated. However, adolescents’ social location did not play a significant role in their perceived feasibility of marriage to a higher caste. Overall, they expected low social mobility concerning marriage. We discuss the complex associations between caste essentialism, social mobility beliefs and social location during adolescence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Polynomial regression and response surface analyses revealed consistent associations of perceived intergenerational and intragenerational social mobility with all three health indicators. Individuals who perceived downward social mobility reported worse health outcomes than those who perceived upward social mobility, but both groups reported poorer health outcomes compared to immobile individuals. Among immobile individuals, the relationship between subjective social status and these health indicators followed an inverted U-shaped pattern, with health indicators initially rising to a peak and then slightly decreased as subjective social status increased. This study offers the first pieces of evidence for the health consequences of perceived social mobility under the Chinese sociocultural context and has potential to challenge the conventional “more is better” model of socioeconomic status. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our findings suggest that higher levels of perceived social mobility are positively associated with political trust. However, this relationship is moderated by economic inequality. Random Effects Within-Between models (REWB) reveal two different effects. Respondents who live in countries with higher levels of economic inequality exhibit lower levels of political trust compared to those living in countries with lower levels of economic inequality, regardless of their social mobility backgrounds. However, as economic inequality increases within countries over time, the political trust gap between mobility groups widens rather than narrows.

Respondents estimate moderate to moderately strong correlations across generations.

Intergenerational downward mobility breaks the promise that new generations should meet the living standards of their parents, a crucial component of the order and political legitimacy of the postwar decades in high-income democracies. We argue that this frustrated expectation fuels populism. Methods: We use data from a cross-national survey conducted in eight European countries in the aftermath of the Great Recession. The survey includes a valid and reliable measure of populist attitudes and a measure of perceived social mobility. Results: Results show a direct effect of perceived downward mobility on populist attitudes. The relationship is robust to different controls and consistent across the eight countries. We also find that socioeconomic factors moderate this relationship due to diverse expectations of social mobility and the different appeal that the populist discourse generates among various social groups. Conclusions: These findings refine the literature on the socioeconomics of populism by nuancing the established connection between low educational attainment, socioeconomic factors and populist attitudes.

	abstract = {This research investigates the impact of power states on consumers' preference for brands using right-enhancing or suffering-reducing appeals in promoting social equality. Through six studies, the present research shows that consumers with low (vs. high) power tend to exhibit a greater preference for brands using right-enhancing (vs. suffering-reducing) appeals. This is because experiencing low (vs. high) power increases consumers’ support for drastic (vs. incremental) social changes to help the disadvantaged group. Additionally, this effect is found to be attenuated when consumers’ perceived social mobility is low. These findings contribute to the existing literature on cause-related marketing by clarifying the factors and psychological mechanisms that influence consumers’ reactions to various advertising messages focused on equality. Additionally, they provide valuable practical insights for marketers, helping them design effective communication strategies tailored to consumers’ power states to promote social equality initiatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, social mobility research focuses disproportionately on objective indicators, and few studies in non-Western contexts examine the role of subjective social mobility. Singapore presents an interesting case, given its commitment to meritocracy and growing social mobility concerns. In an exploratory manner, we first used latent profile analysis to describe Singaporeans’ subjective social mobility. Next, using multinomial logistic regression and linear regression models, we examined how socio-demographic variables relate to subjective social mobility profiles, and how the profiles influence personal and societal optimism and political opinions. Overall, most respondents had Middle Perceived Mobility (versus Low and High). Higher-SES Singaporeans also perceived higher social mobility. Additionally, High Perceived Mobility respondents had consistently higher personal and societal optimism. Overall, political opinions related to jobs, immigration, and integration and cost of living and socio-economic disparities were more varied. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Although evidence exists regarding both the relationship between social capital and actual mobility and about the social capital's influence on individual perceptions, the literature lacks evidence on the possible behavioural aspects related to its influence on the perception of such mobility. Employing data from the seventh wave of the World Values Survey, representing citizens from 63 countries, this study shows that individuals’ social interactions in voluntary associations are significantly related to personal values, particularly the belief in meritocracy and the role of individual effort to obtain success. Consistently with prominent studies highlighting the potential heterogeneous effects of social capital on personal attitudes and behaviours, this research provides evidence that bridging social interactions positively influences the perception of a more mobile and meritocratic society, whereas volunteering in bonding groups may hamper PSM. The size of these effects may depend on the contextual framework because the externalities created by bridging social capital outweigh those of bonding in wealthier countries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We bridged victim and perpetrator perspectives, expecting that objectification victimization positively predicts perpetration, and investigated the mediating role of social dominance orientation (SDO), and gender and perceived social mobility as moderators. Participants (valid N = 530) completed measures of sexual objectification victimization, perceived social mobility, SDO, and sexual objectification perpetration. We found that sexual objectification victimization predicted its perpetration, and that this relationship was stronger among men than women. SDO partially mediated the moderation effect of gender, whereby mediation through SDO was significant among men, but not significant among women. Moreover, a three-way interaction between sexual objectification victimization, gender, and perceived social mobility predicted SDO and carried subsequent implications for sexual objectification perpetration. Despite the mediation effect through SDO not achieving significance among women, it was significantly moderated by perceived social mobility. Specifically, the indirect effect among women with high perceived social mobility was significantly different than that among women with low perceived social mobility, but not significantly different than that among men, whose results were not influenced by perceived social mobility. This study provides a more nuanced understanding of gender in sexual objectification—specifically that gender differences may be related to social power and differences in socialization. The findings offer implications for the development of theories and clinical programs for coping with objectification victimization and preventing perpetration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This finding is partly at odds with accounts of ‘aspirational voters’ being the beneficiaries of local economic growth. Rather, we interpret our findings as supporting the ‘status anxiety’ hypothesis, which attributes negative mobility perceptions with competition for scarce economic and social resources.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a fieldwork study composed of focused, multi-sited and collaborative ethnography principles. It draws upon data from four sport clubs that are members of the Norwegian Equestrian Federation (NEF) and associated with a social inclusion program for people with a history of substance abuse disorders (SUD). Findings: Through the enabling of participants’ agency capabilities through prototypicality, shared leadership and cognitive efforts, incentives for utilizing inclusive leadership are presented. The study also presents perspectives on social mobility that are less prone to inflexible categorization and more attuned to people’s sense of belonging and identities. Originality/value: By coupling unique fieldwork data with theories on subjective social mobility, leadership and meaningfulness, the study presents novel insights into how inclusive leadership play a pivotal role in empowering people with SUD to enhance their social mobility capabilities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The dataset offers novel dimensions that include the questions on global inequality and global redistribution, individual position in global distribution, the perceived social mobility in the society, perceived gender inequality and perceptions of discrimination against immigrants, among others. Moreover, for a number of questions, it offers a possibility of cross-validation with a range of recent datasets including European Social Survey (2020), European Value Study (2017), and the International Social Survey Program (2019). The first results show that Italians indeed recognize inequality along all dimensions (e.g., socio-economic inequality, gender inequality and inequality between migrants and natives), yet they do not strongly perceive themselves as personally affected by discrimination. Moreover, although cross-validation checks reveal a strong alignment between IneqPer data and other international value surveys, respondents in the IneqPer dataset tend to express slightly more progressive views. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Scholars have proposed various explanations for the radicalization of the protests, as well as for the mass support for this radicalization across various sectors of society. However, economic grievances have been relatively downplayed in attempts to understand the radical protests. Using data from a survey conducted during the suspension of the movement in 2020 (N = 1,574), this study examines the relationship between economic grievances and support for the protests. Through mediation analysis, the findings show that individuals who perceived themselves as belonging to a lower class tended to have a diminished sense of social mobility and equality. These negative perceptions contributed to concerns about the activities of Mainland Chinese individuals and the use of public resources. Thus, these particular economic grievances were found to be positively associated with support for the 2019 movement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We also provided evidence that perceived fairness mediated the nexus between PUSM/PDSM and political trust. Our findings underscored the pivotal role of perceived social mobility in shaping the political trust of Chinese citizens and elucidate the micro-level psychological mechanisms underlying this relationship. Hence, we advocate for the implementation of policies geared towards fostering upward mobility and alleviating inequality, aimed at addressing potential crises in political trust.

	abstract = {Cognitive biases affect how people perceive social class mobility. Previous studies suggest that people find it difficult to estimate actual economic social mobility accurately. These results have also noted differences between regions. While in the United States people overestimate actual economic social mobility, in Europe people tend to underestimate it. Across two independent cross-sectional studies, we examined whether cognitive biases operate in the Spanish context and, if so, whether they depend on the type of social mobility. In Study 1 (N = 480), we tested whether people in Spain have an accurate estimation of actual upward economic societal mobility. The results showed that people in Spain have a pessimistic view of upward societal mobility. In Study 2 (N = 274), we analyzed whether people in Spain are more or less optimistic according to the type of social mobility: Personal vs. societal. We found that Spaniards are more optimistic when estimating their own mobility (i.e., personal mobility) than when estimating the mobility of the Spanish society (i.e., societal mobility). Contrary to our predictions, we found that meritocratic beliefs do not play a relevant role in determining any type of social mobility. These results extend previous research on social mobility and its psychosocial consequences. Furthermore, they are well aligned with a new psychosocial perspective suggesting that social mobility is a multidimensional construct. We also discussed the psychosocial implications of this optimistic bias for personal mobility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Does parents’ status motivation affect their educational product choices for their children? Across seven studies, the authors find that when parents believe that society provides enough opportunities for individuals to achieve higher social status through hard work (i.e., high social mobility), they prioritize the status advancement goal and prefer products that help maximize a child's strengths. However, when parents believe that even if one works hard, the opportunity to climb up the social ladder is limited (i.e., low social mobility), they focus on maintaining their current status and prefer products that help remedy a child's weaknesses. Moreover, the research demonstrates that this effect diminishes when the strength and weakness are in the domains that have low relevance to status. Finally, the research shows that when parents believe that children with specialties are more likely to succeed, they prefer products for maximizing strengths, whereas when they believe that well-rounded children are more likely to succeed, they prefer products for remedying weaknesses, regardless of their perception of social mobility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: In this paper, we examine how self-rated health effects contribute to changes in social mobility over time. Methods: Over time changes in perceived social mobility are defined as (1) changes from 4 years ago to the present, and (2) changes from the present to 4 years in the future. A set of instrumental variable regressions is estimated to address the problems of reverse causality, omitted unobserved confounding variables, and measurement error. Results: Findings suggest that higher levels of self-rated health increase upward mobility. A one-unit increase in self-rated health leads to an increase in perceived social mobility from the past to the present by a factor of 0.368. Likewise, a one-unit increase in self-rated health leads to an increase in the expected perceived social mobility by a factor of 0.709. The results are robust for an alternative set of explanatory factors including country-level aggregated characteristics. Conclusions: Policymakers and health administrators should not ignore the effect of poor health as a significant obstacle to mobility. From the research viewpoint, classic single-stage regression models may underestimate the true magnitude of the health effect on over time changes in social mobility. Our findings also contribute to the literature on the Prospect of Upward Mobility (POUM) hypothesis by showing that health status is a strong determinant of upward mobility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Economic inequality has been demonstrated to be deleterious to subjective well-being. The present study aims to uncover whether perceptions of upward social mobility would buffer the detrimental effects of economic inequality on subjective well-being. To answer this question, the current study utilized a large-scale nationally representative sample in China (N = 63,777) to investigate perceptions of social mobility, economic inequality, and their joint associations with subjective well-being. Multilevel modelling showed that individuals who perceived higher levels of social mobility (both in the past and in the future) had higher levels of subjective well-being, whereas economic inequality was not significantly associated with subjective well-being. More importantly, we found an interaction effect of perceptions of past mobility and economic inequality on subjective well-being. The interaction effect demonstrated that higher economic inequality reduced the positive relationship between past mobility and subjective well-being. These findings indicate perceptions of social mobility may have protective effects on subjective well-being, but such effects could be attenuated by unequal income distributions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

First, university graduates are more likely to experience a downward status transition and are unlikely exposed to a pronounced upward mobility or reproduction of high status; so they are more often characterized by immobility in average status positions. Higher education does not consolidate status privileges in the youth cohort and does not always play the social elevator role. Second, the analysis of mobility patterns in the context of trajectories on the way to university showed that university graduates previously graduated from high school are characterized by reproduction of high status. Last, trajectories with master’s degree turned out to be more ”risky“ than with only baccalaureate: master’s degree graduates are more likely to move either up or down the social ladder, while undergraduate trajectories are more characterized by status reproduction.

	abstract = {Purpose: Drawing upon the cognitive-behavioral model of pathological Internet use (PIU) and tunnel effect, this study aimed to construct a moderated mediation model from the perspective of social ecology. Specifically, the model investigated the relationship between perceived social mobility and smartphone dependence, with a focus on the mediating role of hope and the moderating effect of family socioeconomic status (SES) underlying this relationship. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 718 Chinese university students (M<inf>age</inf> = 19.19, 70.2% female) from Beijing, Henan, and Tianjin, who anonymously filled out the Perceptions of Socioeconomic Mobility Scale, Mobile Phone Addiction Index Scale, Openness to the Future Scale, and family socioeconomic status questionnaire. Preliminary data analysis was executed using SPSS 22.0, and the moderated mediation effect was tested using the latent moderated structural equations approach in Mplus 8.3. Results: The results showed that (a) less perceived social mobility was linked with greater smartphone dependence; (b) hope mediated the aforementioned relationship; and (c) family SES moderated the first-stage path of the indirect effect through hope. For university students with low (rather than high) family SES, their level of hope increased with the improvement of perceived social mobility, and in turn, that of smartphone dependence decreased. Conclusion: These findings suggest that positive perceptions of upward social class mobility and hopeful attitudes toward future opportunities and personal development among disadvantaged university students may alleviate their reliance on smartphones. Researchers and policymakers should pay attention to the role of individuals’ perceptions of the macro environment in motivating specific risky behaviors among university students. Future interventions are essential to mitigate pessimistic environmental perceptions and foster a sense of hope among university students. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent works in the field of Social Psychology have shown the importance of studying subjective social mobility from different perspectives. In the literature about subjective societal mobility, most of the research is focused on the mobility-immobility framing. However, several authors suggested studying social mobility beliefs effects differentiating according to mobility’s trajectory, that is, upward (i.e., improving status over time) and downward (i.e., getting worse in status over time). The present research was motivated by the lack of measures that discriminate between beliefs in upward and downward societal mobility. Across two studies using different samples of the Spanish adult population, we examined both dimensions of social mobility beliefs and tested their predictive validity on other related constructs. In Study 1 (N = 164), with an EFA, we corroborated the independence between the two types of mobility. The internal structure was confirmed by a CFA in Study 2 (N = 400). Furthermore, it was shown that upward and downward mobility beliefs are differently related to other related constructs. The results from Studies 1–2 showed good convergent validity. In all correlations with the different constructs (attitudes towards inequality, meritocratic beliefs, justification of the economic system, and status anxiety) we found opposite direction effects for both types of societal mobility (upward and downward). The development of this new instrument can help to deepen our understanding of the psychosocial consequences of subjective social mobility, as well as to differentiate two processes that may have different consequences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We assume that inequality aversion and perception of social mobility affect the impact of regional inequality on subjective well-being in opposite directions. We find evidence of an inverse U-shaped effect of inequality, where inequality starts to have a positive effect on subjective well-being that becomes negative with a switch point before the average of the Gini index for the entire sample. The rationale for our nonlinear finding is that Hirschman's tunnel effect (and the positive effect of perceived social mobility) prevails for low levels of inequality, while inequality aversion and negative relative income effects are relatively stronger when inequality is higher. Robustness checks on different sample splits are consistent with the hypothesis of the two drivers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Drawing on the economic environment that facilitated social mobility in South Korea, we postulate each age group had a different extent of social mobility, which would vary with the extent of economic growth and affect the association between social mobility and health. We used data from KDI National Happiness Survey 2018 and measured perceived mobility using respondents’ perceived social position and their parents’ social position. We examined whether social mobility was associated with self-rated health and psychological well-being. The upwardly mobile individuals were more likely than the stable ones to report ‘happy’. Such a positive association between upward mobility and happiness was consistently found when the sample was restricted to the ages 30–59 and 40–49. For self-rated health, the downwardly mobile individuals were less likely to report good health. However, no significant difference in self-rated health was found after the youngest and oldest age groups were excluded. We found that perceived social mobility was strongly associated with psychological well-being rather than self-rated health. Moreover, we found a stronger association between upward mobility and happiness among the aged 40–49, who had the largest proportion of upwardly mobile individuals and spent their adolescence during rapid economic growth. The findings underscore the importance of the economic and social context in which individuals perceive their social position and shape their well-being. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, with some studies reporting a strong middling tendency, there seems to be a large discrepancy between how people perceive their social position and their actual economic status. Surprisingly, even with the most unequal society label, South Africa has received little attention on the dynamics behind how people perceive their social status. This study uses an ordered probit regression to analyze the determinants of individuals’ subjective social status in South Africa. Results show that objective factors, education, and occupation status positively influence subjective social status. However, subjective social mobility and class imagery are as crucial, confirming the multidimensionality behind subjective social status. Given the high-income polarization and racial inequality in South Africa, the study also showed that factors driving subjective social status are heterogeneous for different race and income groups. The results confirm this and find that discrepant objective and subjective factors influence different populations’ and income groups’ subjective social status. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing interest in the subjective aspect of socioeconomic position and its implications for wellbeing across social science disciplines. One of the emerging dimensions of this scholarship is research on perceived social mobility, its determinants, and consequences. To date, most existing evidence in this area is based on cross-sectional data and corresponding methods, which are biased by the unobserved heterogeneity of individuals. The latter calls into question existing findings on the nature of perceived social mobility. To provide more robust estimates of trends over time and explanations of perceived social mobility, we explore two complementary datasets covering the period between the late 1990s and the late 2010s in Poland. Due to the major economic, political and social changes, exploring subjective perceptions of intergenerational mobility might be particularly important in post-communist settings. The analysis allows us to conclude that, over the last two decades, significant changes in perceived social mobility have taken place in Poland. In terms of the individual-level predictors of this trend, cross-sectional and random-effects analyses over-estimate the importance of certain characteristics, such as age, education, or size of locality, yet, based on the results from more robust fixed-effects estimates, we conclude that factors such as subjective social position, household income, and objective social mobility are important explanations as to why some people believe they are doing better or worse than their parents. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This phenomenon is known as the Easterlin Paradox (i.e., there is no link between a society’s economic development and its average level of happiness) in Western countries. This study examined the effects of subjective social class on subjective well-being and mental health in China. Consequently, we found that individuals in a relatively low social class had lower levels of subjective well-being and mental health; self-class discrepancy partially explains the relationship between subjective social class and subjective well-being and fully explains the relationship between subjective social class and mental health; and subjective social mobility moderates the path from self-class discrepancy to subjective well-being and mental health. These findings suggest that enhancing social mobility is an important method for reducing class differences in subjective well-being and mental health.

Yet, neo-nomadic practices are increasingly involving lower-to middle-class people. They may experience a sense of freedom and subjective upward social mobility; however, their lives are also marked by precarious conditions. We investigate this tension through ethnographic research and interviews with digital nomads in coworking spaces in Barcelona and street vendors in São Paulo. We analyse the links between self-employment and neo-nomadism in their trajectories by drawing on literature on subjective social mobility. We find that emic definitions of “moving up” among our research participants involve three existential dimensions: (1) the quest for freedom, or the subjective sense of social mobility associated with mastering one’s time and choices; (2) the valuation of flexibility, or positive imaginaries of (transnational) spatial mobility and its advantages; and (3) the desire for personal growth, connected with discourses of self-improvement, self-reliance, and individualisation. We argue that entrepreneurship can be analysed as a frame for developing self-reliance and self-improvement in neoliberal contexts where individuals face increasing levels of uncertainty and precarisation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It examines existing theoretical approaches to defining and studying subjective mobility, identifying two primary directions: subjective mobility as the consequence of objective mobility experienced by an individual, and subjective mobility as an evaluation of mobility experiences. A brief overview of the main empirical studies in each direction is provided. The article also explores common methods of measuring subjective mobility, such as success, comparing achieved professional status to parental status and living standards. It analyzes the potential of using subjective well-being as an indicator for measuring subjective mobility. Drawing from data collected by an all-Russian survey conducted in 2020 as part of the “Factors of Social Well-being in Changing and Stable Societies” study, the article identifies four types of subjective mobility, each distinguished by the individual perception of mobility experience and a parental well-being assessment. Binary logistic regression models calculated for each mobility type allowed the researchers to determine the influence of different factors on the perception of subjective mobility. The findings corroborated some trends identified in studies based on international data. The conclusion highlights that, for the subjective perception of mobility, the most significant factors are not structural indicators but the assessment of relationships with parents and emotional well-being. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While prior work has examined ethical judgments toward inequality itself (e.g., “is inequality unethical?”), less is known about how inequality shapes judgments of unethical behavior (e.g., “is unethical behavior more acceptable?”). In two correlational studies, we find that higher objective (Study 1; n= 127,953) and subjective (Study 2; n= 806) inequality is associated with greater acceptability of self-interested unethical behavior. In Studies 3a–6b (total N = 4,851; preregistered), we manipulated perceived inequality and test several mediating pathways. Results point toward the importance of sense of control as a mechanism: Under conditions of high inequality, individuals report a lower sense of control, which increases the acceptability of self-interested unethical behaviors. As a supplement, we also explore associations regarding why high inequality reduces sense of control (reduced perceptions of social mobility) and why sense of control is associated with greater acceptability of unethical behavior (greater situational attributions). Overall, our results suggest inequality changes ethical standards by reducing one’s sense of control, providing evidence for another pathway through which inequality harms societies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Use of an original field survey undergirds the finding that, in contrast to conventional understandings of Brazilian racial and social dynamics, beneficiary status operates differently for Afro-Brazilian and White beneficiaries, as well as for male and female beneficiaries. Specifically, that the program has significant empowerment effects for White women beneficiaries, but that it does not affect the evaluations of Afro-Brazilian women. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the logic of human capital formation in authoritarian regimes based on theories of inequality and regime transition and the prospect of upward mobility model. Our central argument is that by investing in human capital, dictators can boost citizens’ perceived levels of social mobility. Consequently, dictators can preemptively ameliorate the pressure for redistribution from the poor and neutralize threats from the masses. In other words, dictators invest in human capital as a way of increasing citizens’ perceived social mobility and thus sustaining political stability in their authoritarian regimes. Our cross-national analysis covers more than 80 authoritarian regimes from 1970 to 2010 and shows that higher levels of education spending are associated with a lower probability of regime breakdown in autocracies. We further use a causal mediation analysis with the Asian Barometer Survey data and connect our causal link from human capital formation to perceived social mobility and then to authoritarian regime support. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this research, I elicit rural students’ narratives about their (classed) perceptions of clothing and style, as well as the bodily practices embedded in their subjective social mobility experiences in the unique social milieu of China’s context. I argue that participants’ transforming practices entail a nexus of challenge to and also compliance with the urban field. Through the theoretical lens of habitus, I illustrate how rural students strategically transform their ‘style’, as dispositions of habitus, in the urban field to obtain valued forms of embodied capital. At the same time, I emphasise the importance of viewing rural students’ embodied transformations critically, as it entails both their effective generation of valued capital to actively adapt to the urban field and their (involuntary) compliance to the oppressive social relations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We study how meritocratic beliefs about success relate to individuals’ social mobility experiences: Is subjective upward mobility associated with meritocratic attributions of success and downward mobility with structuralist views? Whereas previous studies addressed the relevance of individuals’ current position or objective mobility, we leverage diagonal reference models to disentangle the role of subjective mobility, origin, and destination. Surveying a representative Dutch sample (n = 1,507), we find, echoing the Thomas theorem, that if people experience social mobility as real, it is real in its consequences: subjective upward mobility is associated with stronger meritocratic beliefs, and downward mobility is associated with stronger structuralist beliefs—but has no bearing on people’s meritocracy beliefs. This helps understand the muted political response to growing inequality: a small share of upwardly mobile individuals may suffice to uphold public faith in meritocracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The academic literature argues that understandings of the subjective experience of social mobility differ from objective measure of social mobility – based on occupational patterns of movement – because people tend to conflate changes of the social structure (social change) and changes within the social structure (social mobility), resulting in a limited sense of social inequalities. This article explores subjective understandings of social mobility through the lens of Chilean school-teachers’ narratives of their life trajectories. Methodologically, data were collected through in-depth interviews with 41 teachers who live in Santiago. They were also asked to draw a timeline with the main transitions in their lives. The findings of this article show that teachers’ evaluations of their trajectories are first expressed as narratives relating to their life satisfaction. Differential forms of social comparison that emerge from teachers’ evaluations of their trajectories reveal how people position themselves within a broader structure of social inequalities. In consequence, teachers’ evaluations of their trajectories contain implicit or explicit narratives of social mobility which are often bound up with a subjective sense of social change and life-course change. This article demonstrates that lay understandings of social mobility potentially illuminate academic understandings, by addressing a multidimensional and fluid model of social mobility as well as the practical experiences of inequalities that frame people’s everyday lives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In 2021, we commissioned a nationally representative survey in Georgia which included a population-wide randomized survey experiment. We confirmed the association between, on the one hand, perceived social mobility and, on the other hand, physical and mental health, satisfaction with life, and the perceived state of affairs in the country. More importantly, the experimental design allowed us to conclude that the perception of being downwardly mobile was causally determined by a short message shared with individuals that equality of opportunity in their country was low. Those who were given information that children’s socioeconomic position was strongly linked to their parents’ socioeconomic position were seven percentage points more likely than individuals in the control group to perceive themselves as being downwardly mobile. We extrapolate these findings to the broader context and argue that the messages about (in)equality of opportunity which individuals receive in their everyday lives might also shape their perceptions of social mobility in other countries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Children’s subjective social mobility is about how they perceive their future social position compared to their parents’. Social ecology refers to the influential multi-layered surrounding factors, including family, school, and community. We analyzed data from structured questionnaires completed by 2221 migrant children (1296 boys and 925 girls, with a mean age of 11.7 years) from three private schools in Guangzhou and Foshan, China. The findings indicate that participants anticipated a significant improvement in their future social status. Of the factors influencing this belief, community integration has the most significant impact (TE = 0.246), followed by school integration (TE = 0.220) and family socioeconomic status (TE = 0.053). We also found that children’s self-concept plays a role in their perceptions of social mobility. Based on the study results, we propose recommendations to provide migrant children additional protection and enhance their living environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A questionnaire (N = 570, aged 14 to 20) was conducted in a Xinjiang Class school in Southern China to examine the nexus of students’ ethnic identity, national identity and perception on social mobility. The Xinjiang Class is currently one of the most iconic preferential educational policies recruiting students from ethnic groups in Xinjiang (an ethnic minority-concentrated border region) and offering them senior secondary education in select Han-centric, senior-secondary schools in China’s central and east coast provinces. The results demonstrate that the strengthening effect of students’ ethnic identity on national identity is not obvious; students’ strong national identity contributes to their positive perception on upward social mobility. However, the widely accepted viewpoint that students’ ethnic identity has a negative influence on perception of social mobility cannot be fully supported in this case. This study enriches the extant literature by providing a combined model to explore the nuanced mechanisms between ethnic identity, national identity and students’ perception on social mobility in a multi-ethnic society and by helping to unveil the identity politics unfolded in current China’s educational sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In addition to the perceived level of inequality typically measured in previous studies, we explore perceptions about who is rich and poor and their share of the population. The shape of perceived inequality that we find provides new insights as to why people tolerate large differences between the rich and the poor. We find that Mexicans generally perceive poverty and inequality not too far from measured levels, but they overestimate the income of the rich and their proportion of the population. Their perceptions of social mobility correctly estimate persistence rates at the top and bottom of the distribution, but they overestimate upward and downward mobility. Providing people with more information about observed income inequality and social mobility could be one way to encourage a demand for redistribution. However, randomly providing selected participants with this information has almost zero effect on their desired levels of equality, social mobility, and tax rates. Finally, we find that Mexicans want a progressive tax system in which the poor pay an average tax rate of 14% and the wealthy pay 41%, and that preference for a more progressive tax structure is negatively related to socioeconomic status. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Rationale: The question as to whether changing one's socioeconomic position over the life course affects health has not been answered in a conclusive manner. At the same time, it has been established that individuals who think of themselves that they are higher in the social hierarchy are healthier than those who think otherwise. Objective: In this study, we focus on perceived social mobility to shed new light on the issue of how social mobility affects health. We examine whether perceived social mobility, i.e., an individual's appraisal of doing better or worse than their parents, affects health by analyzing longitudinal data from Poland. Methods: Using a fixed effects approach to account for all time-invariant and important time-varying confounders, we analyze the Polish Panel Survey which has been collecting data on participants’ social mobility perceptions along with information on their self-reported physical health and psychological wellbeing. Results: We find that perceived social mobility is a significant predictor of self-reported physical health and psychological wellbeing, even in models that adjust for a host of theoretically relevant control variables. The results demonstrate that upward subjective mobility has a consistent and strong positive effect on health outcomes. The effect of perceived social mobility is stronger for males and for those with less advantageous social origins. Conclusions: Our findings are in line with the “from rags to riches” theoretical perspective, emphasizing the positive implications of upward social mobility on health through various psychological mechanisms. Based on our findings, we call for greater scholarly attention to subjective aspects of social mobility in research on health outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The authors show that, in terms of the perception of income inequality by the population, the situation resembles the one seen in the 1990s, during a completely different stage of the country's development. The overwhelming majority of Russians today consider income inequality to be unnecessarily high and unfair. Such perceptions and the associated high demand for redistribution do not differ across socio-demographic and socio-economic groups. The experience of social mobility also does not lead to significant differentiation in this respect, and the expected mobility in the medium term is characterized by a weak influence. Only short-term expectations work relatively noticeably in this regard: if they are positive, they reduce the negative perception of income inequality and the demand for redistribution. As for the perception of non-monetary inequalities, normative ideas about their minimization aimed at achieving social justice turn out to be similar in groups with different directions of expected or already completed mobility. Thereby, the perception of both monetary and non-monetary inequalities, as well as requests for their reduction, are formed to a greater extent on the basis of normative ideas about the “proper” structure of society and an assessment of its compliance with the observed reality than on the characteristics of an individual situation, including expected or actual mobility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

For this purpose, we use more than 180,000 individuals from 51 countries in the most recent five waves (1990–2014) of the World Values Survey. We observe a significant tradeoff between life satisfaction, happiness and the Gini coefficient. Also, inequality is negatively associated with life satisfaction and happiness for lower-income groups as well as higher-income groups. Interestingly, our data also shows large scale embracement of inequality in self-reported attitudes as even almost half (49%) of the lower-income group support the statement that some inequality is necessary for sustaining individual effort. Perceived freedom, and perceived social mobility partially mediates the relationship between the Gini coefficient and subjective wellbeing indicators. Yet, there remains a substantial negative effect of inequality on subjective well-being. Nevertheless, when individuals’ perception of fairness is included, the effect of inequality disappears for both higher-income and lower-income groups. Overall, our findings suggest that people are bothered by inequality primarily due to fairness concerns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the mechanisms through which family SES is associated with adolescents’ academic achievement are not well understood. Therefore, this study examined the mediating roles of different types of parental involvement (i.e., parental school-based involvement, academic socialization, and home-based involvement) and the moderating role of adolescents’ subjective social mobility in the relationships between family SES and academic achievement by using multisource data. The valid sample consisted of 842 adolescents ((Formula presented.) = 12.28 years, 40.97% girls) who were recruited from five township public schools in China. The results indicated that all three types of parental involvement partially mediated the relationships between family SES and adolescents’ Chinese and math achievement; parental school-based involvement had the strongest mediating effects, followed by academic socialization, and home-based involvement had the lowest mediating effects. Moreover, the path from parental home-based involvement to Chinese achievement in the mediation model was moderated by the adolescents’ subjective social mobility. In conclusion, parental involvement is an important mediating mechanism through which a low family SES impedes adolescents’ academic achievement, and adolescents’ subjective social mobility can play a buffering role in the relationship between parental home-based involvement and Chinese achievement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Previous studies on migrant adolescents focused on the impact of a single type of risk exposure. The cumulative risk approach considers a number of risk factors, providing a new perspective for investigating the living environment of individuals exposed to multiple risks simultaneously. The current study examined the relationship between cumulative risk and hopelessness among rural-to-urban migrant adolescents and the potential protective roles of stress mindset and subjective social mobility on this relationship. A total of 251 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents aged 10 to 14 completed a series of self-reported questionnaires. The results showed that adolescents exposed to more risk factors simultaneously faced a higher risk of hopelessness. For those with a stress-is-enhancing mindset or the belief in the possibility of upward social mobility, the link between cumulative risk and hopelessness was nonsignificant. When the two moderators were considered simultaneously, only subjective social mobility acted as a moderator. The findings showed that both the stress-is-enhancing mindset and subjective social mobility may act as protective variables to decrease the negative influence of adverse circumstances on Chinese migrant adolescents, but the effect of the latter is stable. The practical implications for promoting the development of disadvantaged adolescents are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the past several decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the costs of college attendance, which puts political pressure on what the roles of government and families in education financing ought to be. In this study, we examine how individuals' perception of society's intergenerational mobility affects their willingness to financially support children in college, as well as their opinion on whether the government should take a smaller or bigger role. Perceptions of mobility matter because they reflect individuals' estimated opportunity structure and thereby an important component of returns to education. Using data from a nationally representative online survey and a novel design to measure perceived mobility, we show that (1) individuals who believe to live in a more mobile society exhibit more aversion toward government spending and a preference for students relying on family support; (2) these associations are stronger among higher-SES groups; and (3) information treatments randomly assigning objective social mobility facts make individuals who overestimate the level of social mobility even more eager to contribute to tuition costs. These findings suggest that learning about factual levels of mobility reinforces existing beliefs and possibly their consequences for educational investment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The protective factors in the relationship between SES and executive function have not been sufficiently investigated, especially from the perspective of parents’ and children’s perceptions and expectations regarding SES. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether parental subjective SES and children’s subjective social mobility separately moderated the relationship between family SES and children’s executive function among 885 participants aged 9–13 years. The results showed that family SES was positively related to the three components of executive function (cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, and working memory). Moreover, the relationship between SES and cognitive flexibility was weak among the children with a high level of subjective social mobility or those whose parents had high levels of subjective SES. Among children from families with economic hardship, subjective social mobility is a potential protective factor mitigating the negative effects of low family SES on their cognitive flexibility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The consequences of changing one's socio-economic status over the life course—i.e. social mobility—for individual health are not well understood. Theories of the health implications of social mobility draw on the human perception of one's changing conditions, but empirical studies mostly examine the health implications of moving from objectively defined indicators of parental socio-economic position such as education, occupation, or income, to own socio-economic position in adult life. Little is known about the consequences of individuals’ own assessment of changes in socio-economic position for health outcomes. In this study, we examine the association of social mobility and health in a unique sample of the Russian population after the transition to a market society. We take a broad perspective on social mobility, putting emphasis on subjectively perceived social mobility. Results show that individuals’ objective characteristics only partially explain the variation in their subjective perceptions of intergenerational mobility. Net of social origin and destination variables, subjective social mobility is associated with individuals’ health outcomes, as measured by the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Those who perceive being upwardly mobile report better health, and downward mobility is associated with poorer health. The association holds for mental and physical health, for perceived downward and upward social mobility, and for a general subjective measure of mobility and a subjective measure prompting respondents to only think of mobility in terms of occupation. These findings are robust to controlling for a rich set of socio-demographic predictors on childhood adversity, contemporaneous material wellbeing, and family-related circumstances. We conclude that a conventional focus on single socio-economic status dimensions such as occupation might be too narrow to capture the health consequences of social mobility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

One program designed to help address this issue, the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP), provides eligible First Nations students with post-secondary education funding. Although such programs are beneficial, it is unclear how much Canadians support public funding of Indigenous education and whether psychological research can help explain why some may endorse or oppose it. Thus, using the PSSSP as an example, we examined five possible psychological predictors of public support: personal prejudice toward Indigenous Peoples, perceived social mobility, meritocratic beliefs, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that all would negatively relate to support for the PSSSP. In a sample of non-Indigenous Canadian adults, we found that only higher personal prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism uniquely explained lower support for the program (or conversely, lower prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political liberalism were related to higher program support). Although correlational, this study provides insight into factors that may influence Canadians’ attitudes toward a program aimed at addressing a consequential societal inequality. We discuss the implications of these findings in regard to support for programs and policies targeted at marginalized groups. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To overcome contradictory first impressions, we propose a comprehensive approach to migrants’ self-assessments that goes beyond the opposition between objective and subjective social mobility and links the transnational context, various social spheres, actors’ migratory projects, and their reflexivity. The empirical materials in this article draw on two studies on Chinese migrants in France and confront the trajectories and viewpoints of undocumented migrants and international students. Beyond the differences between their experiences and their legal, economic, and social statuses in France and China, we highlight several common points: First, both groups considered migration a lever to improve their social status. Second, their evaluations link their regions of origin and destination as well as various social spheres. Third, in a transnational context, many factors at different scales influence migrants’ subjective self-assessments of the success or failure of their migration. The migrants’ assessments can vary according to their emphasis on professional, personal, or family trajectories, or on their choice of reference groups. They are shaped by the complexity of translations of status from one country to another and by rapid social transformation in China. Thus, many interviewees estimate that they are simultaneously in situations of social progression and regression. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One’s current socioeconomic position is intimately tied to one’s health status. Further, childhood living conditions also exert lasting effects on the health of adults. However, studies on changes in one’s socioeconomic position over the life course rarely find consistent and systematic effects of social mobility for individual health and wellbeing. Such studies almost exclusively draw on objective measures of social mobility and do not consider subjective appraisals of social mobility by individuals themselves. We conduct an analysis of cross-sectional, representative German survey data to explore the question as to how subjective perceptions as opposed to objective accounts of occupational status mobility affect five self-reported health and wellbeing outcomes differentially. We show that objective and subjective accounts of social mobility overlap, yet this association is far from perfect. Further, there are relatively small associations between objective and subjective mobility accounts and health outcomes. Associations between subjective mobility perceptions and health outcomes are intriguingly independent of objective social mobility trajectories. Mismatches between objective and subjective mobility are also correlated with some health outcomes. We discuss implications of our findings that social mobility is associated with those aspects of health which are more closely related to psychological wellbeing rather than physical health. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Albeit middle-class citizens have generally been assumed to support democracy, studies investigating this class’s political attitudes using survey data have produced mixed results. This paper argues that one reason for these ambiguities is that the middle class may not be a homogenous group. Specifically, I explore how diverging perceptions of social mobility tend to condition political attitudes towards democracy within different social strata, particularly within the middle class. Drawing upon data from the South African Social Attitudes Survey, the article finds no strong evidence of any middle-class particularism in people’s opinions about democracy. Rather, the main difference in democratic attitudes and civic values is detected between those persistently locked in poverty and the rest of the population. Interestingly, the upwardly mobile ‘escapers’ and the ‘climbers’ show significantly higher levels of trust in public institutions and tend to display higher beliefs in voting as an effective tool to influence politics compared to both the persistently poor and the ‘anxious’ middle class, between whom no significant difference is found. These empirical findings demonstrate the limits to understanding people’s political attitudes in relation to their current standard of living alone. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using both objective and subjective measures of social mobility, we found that young people’s perceptions of their own social mobility and that of the entire youth population correlated positively with life satisfaction. However, the objective upward experiences of intragenerational and intergenerational mobility did not have a significant effect on life satisfaction. In addition, the objective upward experiences of individuals were found to be uncorrelated with the perceptions of their own social mobility and that of the entire youth population. These findings suggest that young people will not become more satisfied even if they themselves have actually experienced upward mobility, because their positive perception of social mobility depends on whether they can move upward to their desired status. It is the expected social mobility and the competence to achieve rather than the actual past mobility experience that could affect the life satisfaction of the young generation in Taiwan and Hong Kong. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Aims: The present study examined the mediating role of parental academic involvement and the moderating role of parental subjective social mobility in this relationship with cross-sectional data. Sample and methods: A total of 815 fourth- to sixth-grade children were recruited from five elementary schools in China. Family SES (measured by parents’ education, parents’ occupation and family income) and parental subjective social mobility were obtained directly from parents, parental academic involvement was reported by children, and information on children’s academic achievement was collected from their teachers. Results: The results showed that (1) both family SES and parental academic involvement were positively correlated with children’s Chinese and math achievement, (2) parental academic involvement mediated the relationships between family SES and children’s Chinese and math achievement, and (3) parental subjective social mobility moderated the path from family SES to parental academic involvement. The models of children’s Chinese and math achievement showed that the association between family SES and parental academic involvement was weak among children’s parents who reported high levels of subjective social mobility. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there is a pathway from family SES to children’s academic achievement through parental academic involvement and that this pathway is dependent on the level of parental subjective social mobility. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Adolescents with low family socioeconomic status (SES) often have lower academic achievement than their peers with high family SES. However, less is known about the personal buffering mechanisms on the relationship between low family SES and academic achievement for youth. To address adolescents’ academic achievement gap related to family SES, this study aimed to test whether family SES predicted adolescents’ academic achievement and whether adolescents’ subjective social mobility and attention moderated this relationship with longitudinal data. Valid participants included 827 adolescents (M<inf>age</inf> = 12.30 years, range: 11–14 years, SD = 0.87, and 40.99% girls) from five township public schools in China. The results showed that family SES (comprising parents’ education, parents’ occupation, and family income) was positively correlated with adolescents’ academic achievement (i.e., Chinese and math) when controlling for prior academic achievement. The positive associations between family SES and both Chinese and math achievement 9 months later were nonsignificant for adolescents with higher levels of subjective social mobility. In addition, the positive effect of family SES on Chinese achievement 9 months later was nonsignificant among adolescents with higher levels of attention. In conclusion, low family SES impairs adolescents’ Chinese and math achievement, high levels of adolescents’ subjective social mobility can buffer the adverse effects of low family SES on both Chinese and math achievement, and high levels of adolescents’ attention can buffer the adverse effects of family SES on Chinese achievement but not on math achievement. These findings may emphasize the significance of developing differential interventions aimed at specific subject achievement for adolescents with low family SES. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, empirical studies found inconsistent findings. In the present research, we argue that at least part of the confusion stems from the possibility that objective and subjective SES are differently related to system justification. On one hand, subjective SES is more related to status maintenance motivation and may increase system justification. On the other hand, objective SES is more related to access to information about the social reality, which may increase criticism about the system and lead to lower system justification. These hypotheses were supported by evidence from five studies (total N = 26,134) involving both adult and adolescent samples in China. We recommend that future research on status-related issues needs to distinguish the potential divergent roles of objective and subjective SES. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Drawing on a survey of university students (N = 1245), the study finds that self-interest and ideology, and specifically perceptions of social mobility and individual responsibility, are strong predictors of support for redistribution. The vignette experiment provides evidence that politics indeed spills over into support for welfare policies. Respondents expressed less support for public housing if cued that the policy was associated with the government and were already dissatisfied with political leadership.

We have found that the socioeconomic level of the students determines the current conditions and also future perspectives. In general, students of lower socioeconomic status not only present the most adverse conditions to access and remain in the higher education system, but also their expectations for the future are lower compared to students of higher socioeconomic status, which limits the role of higher education on social mobility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Based on a proposed theoretical framework, the current research examines whether or not perception about busyness affects perceived self-worth and has an impact on impulsive buying. Research design, data, and methodology: The paper conducted a survey in which two scenarios are used for manipulating degree of busy mindset. For analyzing data, analysis of variance and regression analysis are applied, in conjunction with analysis of moderating effects. Results: Busy mindset has a positive effect on perceived self-worth. The effect of busy mindset on perceived self-worth is greater in the group of high perceived social mobility. In the category of hedonic products, perceived self-worth has a positive effect on impulsive buying intention. Conclusions: These results imply that a sense of self-worth can affect impulsive buying behavior on the basis that people sometimes buy things on impulse as a way of self-indulgence or self-reward for their efforts. Managerial implications of the results suggest a busy appeal to consumers would be more effective for hedonic products. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The positive effect of income is more pronounced for rural and western migrants, and is shown to be significantly correlated with the poor’s SWB but not for the well-being of more affluent respondents. Interestingly, high-income earners are more hurt by income inequality than low-income respondents. Moreover, compared with migrants in other regions, those in less developed Western China are found to be more averse to income inequality. Our results are quite robust to different specifications. We provide novel explanations for these findings by delving into psychological channels, including egalitarian preferences, social comparison concerns, expectations, perceived fairness concerns and perceived social mobility. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To offer an integrative account bridging individuals’ sociocultural orientations with pro-environmentalism, the current research tested the mediating and moderating relationships among pro-environmental intentions and three person-level factors: perceived social mobility, cosmopolitan orientation, and social dominance orientation (SDO). With a Singaporean college student sample (N = 220), we found support for the hypothesized second-stage moderation model that perceived social mobility positively predicts cosmopolitan orientation, and in turn, cosmopolitan orientation is moderated by SDO to positively predict pro-environmental intentions. Specifically, lower levels of SDO strengthen the pro-environmental advantages of endorsing higher levels of cosmopolitan orientation. These findings add novel knowledge to the environmental psychology literature by advancing an integrative approach that demonstrates how the interplay of people's perceptions about the social, cultural, and group standing impacts their likelihood to engage in pro-environmental actions. We discuss the implications that an egalitarian worldview toward other cultures, social groups, and human–nature relations might be the key to addressing the global challenge of climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The data for this study were collected in 2014 and 2016, from one middle school in China. The school deployed a Chinese ethnic minority education policy, aimed at cultivating youth elites who uphold the Chinese government. The educational process involved significant interventions in the students’ identity building and their perception of social mobility. The total sample of 338 students was recruited in 2014 for exploratory factor analysis (EFA), while 609 students were recruited in the same school in 2016 for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). EFA was first used to devise an optimal structure. The results of EFAs supported a two-factor solution to ethnic identity: commitment and exploration; a three-factor solution for national identity: commitment, exploration, and behavioral involvement; and a three-factor solution for perception of social mobility: sense of being elite, perception of social status, and educational attainment. The second step was to confirm the structure, using CFA methods. CFA showed that the eight-factor model for Ethnic Identity, National Identity, and Perception of Social Mobility Scale provides a good fit for the data. These findings shed light on a combined way of approaching the relationship between identity building and social mobility within the educational sectors of a multi-ethnic society. Based on a Chinese context, this study offers a situated and contextualized quantitative approach to examining the Chinese state’s efforts toward identity building and promoting upward social mobility within the educational sector. Future research and the potential limitations of the study are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

By adopting a historical perspective, the article shows how migrations have been changing according to migratory culture of different ethnical groups and affiliation to migratory networks. It focuses on the inequalities to the access to migrations, caused by the individuals’ different positions in lineages, communities and global society, that lead to the formulation of different migratory strategies. After arguing that the main motivation of Guinean migrants is a quest of upward social mobility, the article recalls the difference between objective and subjective mobility, that thrives the migratory imaginary. Finally, in a perspective of dynamic socio-anthropology, migration is considered as an historical construction that is associated with internal dynamisms of Diakhanké communities in the Boke region. The observation of this community in 2017 reveals a transformation of migrations, namely in terms of democratization of the possibility to migrate for ethnic groups not affiliated to migratory networks, but also for youngsters and women who migrate individually, without taking into account the advice of the community and the extended family. On one hand, by elaborating alone their migratory project, many young people have tried to emancipate from their elders; on the other hand, young women can realize their dream independently from their husbands’ consent or the decision made by parents and elderly people. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Once in the United States, Latino immigrants may face many challenges, including discrimination and blocked opportunities for social mobility, and difficulties in obtaining health services and quality health care. The purpose of this study was to explore how changes in social mobility from the country of origin to the U.S. may relate to Latina women's health care interactions. We examined whether self-reported social mobility among 419 Latina women immigrants is associated with satisfaction with health care. We also examined the association among social mobility and self-rated health, quality of care, and medical mistrust. Upward social mobility was associated with greater number of years lived in the U.S., and downward social mobility was associated with more years of education. Those who reported no changes in social class (stable social mobility) were older and were the most satisfied with their medical care. Multiple regression analyses indicated that downward social mobility was associated with less satisfaction with care when controlling for demographic covariates, quality of care, and medical mistrust. Results suggest that perceived social mobility may differentially predict Latina immigrants’ satisfaction with the health care system, including their trust in U.S. medical institutions. We conclude that perceived social mobility is an important element in exploring the experiences of immigrant Latinas with health care in the United States. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In a rigorous analysis using a large cross-country dataset, and accounting for the nested structure of the data, as well as controlling for a variety of individual and country characteristics, we find that SWB is higher where income inequality is higher. Importantly, we also find support for this relationship being moderated by perceptions of poverty being caused by unfairness, an individual’s relative socioeconomic standing, as well as beliefs about hard work leading to success.

It puts forward three possibilities concerning distributive justice among rural–urban migrants relative to other groups, based on the social position hypothesis, reference group hypothesis, and subjective mobility hypothesis. Data from the 2010 Chinese General Social Survey largely support the reference group hypothesis. Rural–urban migrants are significantly more likely than urban locals to view their income level and society as fair, and the difference in perceived fairness of own income between the two groups varies by income level. Rural villagers and rural–urban migrants hold similar views on micro justice and macro justice. This paper contributes to the existing literature by suggesting that: (1) socio-economic status is not necessarily positively associated with favorable views of the current distributive system; and (2) social comparisons may play a more important role. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In light of these inconsistencies, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between income inequality and subjective intergenerational mobility. Using data from 40 countries, the effect of income inequality on subjective mobility was examined, along with their combined effect on views regarding redistribution. The results indicated that income inequality increases mainly subjective downward mobility. The effect of subjective mobility on the attitudes toward redistribution was found to be substantial, but there were no significant results highlighting an interaction between inequality and subjective mobility. The results show how individual perceptions of opportunity inequalities are affected by the structural constraints of society.

Less is known about how social mobility brought about by migration may be related to the emotional dispositions of immigrants (also referred to as subjective well-being). To examine this relationship, we utilize data from a representative sample of 1,268 first-generation immigrants from 80 different countries living in South Florida. Changes in perceived social mobility between the homeland and the United States—moving up and down the socioeconomic ladder—are indeed associated with differences in immigrants' negative dispositions. We draw from literature on expectations, social comparisons, and subjective class status to explain these findings. We do not find a statistically significant association between changes in socioeconomic status and positive dispositions, which may suggest that losses outweigh migration-related gains. Additionally, findings reveal that nondominant groups fare worse than Cubans (the dominant group in the region) with regard to dispositions. Social comparisons to the dominant ethnic group may explain this, as well as perceptions of relative deprivation experienced by groups not favored by immigration policies and underrepresented in social and economic institutions. We conclude by discussing implications on how negative emotional dispositions represent risk factors that could affect immigrants' mental health. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Several scholars have suggested that Americans’ (distorted) beliefs about the rate of upward social mobility in the United States may affect political judgment and decision-making outcomes. In this article, we consider the psychometric properties of two different questionnaire items that researchers have used to measure these subjective perceptions. Namely, we report the results of a new set of experiments (N = 2,167 U.S. MTurkers) in which we compared the question wording employed by Chambers, Swan and Heesacker (2015) with the question wording employed by Davidai and Gilovich (2015). Each (independent) research team had prompted similar groups of respondents to estimate the percentage of Americans born into the bottom of the income distribution who improved their socio-economic standing by adulthood, yet the two teams reached ostensibly irreconcilable conclusions: that Americans tend to underestimate (Chambers et al.) and overestimate (Davidai & Gilovich) the true rate of upward social mobility in the U.S. First, we successfully reproduced both contradictory results. Next, we isolated and experimentally manipulated one salient difference between the two questions’ response-option formats: asking participants to divide the population into either (a) “thirds” (tertiles) or (b) “20%” segments (quintiles). Inverting this tertile-quintile factor significantly altered both teams’ findings, suggesting that thesemeasures are inappropriate (too vulnerable to question-wording and item-formulation artifacts) for use in studies of perceptual (in)accuracy. Finally, we piloted a new question for measuring subjective perceptions of social mobility. We conclude with tentative recommendations for researchers who wish to model the causes and consequences of Americans’ mobility-related beliefs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The authors argue that a busy and overworked lifestyle, rather than a leisurely lifestyle, has become an aspirational status symbol. A series of studies shows that the positive inferences of status in response to busyness and lack of leisure time are driven by the perceptions that a busy person possesses desired human capital characteristics (e.g., competence and ambition) and is scarce and in demand in the job market. This research uncovers an alternative kind of conspicuous consumption that operates by shifting the focus from the preciousness and scarcity of goods to the preciousness and scarcity of individuals. Furthermore, the authors examine cultural values (perceived social mobility) and differences among cultures (North America vs. Europe) to demonstrate moderators and boundary conditions of the positive associations derived from signals of busyness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To address this research gap, the present study proposed that the association between objective SES and subjective well-being is mediated by subjective SES. This model was tested with a sample of 432 Chinese rural-to-urban migrants. The results indicate a significant association between objective SES and subjective well-being and a partial mediating effect of subjective SES. Furthermore, subjective social mobility, which is one's expectation about the possibility to move upward in the social hierarchy, was found to moderate both the direct path from objective SES to subjective well-being and the indirect path from subjective SES to subjective well-being. These findings suggest that Chinese rural-to-urban migrants gained in subjective well-being not only because of direct financial achievement but also because of their perceptions and beliefs about their relative social status. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Compared to information suggesting moderate social mobility, exposure to low social mobility frames consistently reduced defense of the overarching societal system. Two studies examined how this effect occurs. Compared to moderate or baseline conditions, a low social mobility frame reduced people’s endorsement of (typically strong) meritocratic and just-world beliefs, which in turn explained lower system defense. These effects occurred for political liberals, moderates, and conservatives and could not be explained by other system-legitimizing ideologies or people’s beliefs about their own social mobility.

The described hypotheses are tested by using multinomial and multilevel logistic regressions and two complementary datasets—European Values Studies and the Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings suggest that social mobility is indeed associated with perceptions of individual blame and social blame of why some people are in need.

	abstract = {The nineteenth century saw rapid urbanisation in many locations around the world as agriculture became increasingly mechanised and rural workers moved to towns, following the spread of new centres of manufacture and trade. As a result of this urbanisation, key sites across the UK, the US and Europe saw increased confl ict and found themselves in the midst of compromises and negotiations with their neighbours. Rural–Urban Relationships in the Nineteenth Century is a collection of 12 new essays, presented in four sections which highlight key examples of these rural– urban encounters. They explore the changing working practices, the impact of modernity and different perceptions of social mobility, and examine how rural– urban negotiations were enacted in a range of different regional locations. This volume includes work by both established and emerging specialists from a wide range of disciplines, including literary studies, cultural history and social science. They draw upon a variety of methodological approaches and archival sources, including census records, newspapers, memoirs, contemporary illustrations, literature and private correspondence. This book reveals how, in addition to conflict and cultural anxiety, in some cases social change created welcome new practices and facilitated the formation of positive and enabling relationships, whilst in others tension was always more evident than cooperation. In so doing, the book demonstrates the contribution specific and nuanced micro-historical approaches can make to national cultural histories.

	abstract = {This article examines working class masculinities in post-Soviet Russia and discusses their dynamics in relation to subjective social mobility between 1991 and 2015. The authors approach masculinity from the constructivist theory by Raewyn Connell, who suggests studying how masculinities evolve in multiple domains, such as labour, power, symbolic representations, and emotional relationships. Using the concept of subjective social mobility, the researchers focus on the analysis of the symbolic dimension of class movements, subjective expectations and the anxieties of working-class men about their social status. Our empirical qualitative analysis is based on 62 interviews with Russian industrial workers conducted after 1991. The authors find that traditional and new types of masculinities coexist among the Russian working class. Traditional masculinity is typical among older male workers. It reproduces social practices of the Soviet gender order and forces men to achieve normative masculinity which is, however, barely possible for them to maintain today due to lack of economic resources. Young male workers strive to adopt a new type of masculinity, which contrasts with the traditional model in its independent, active and proactive character. Moreover, it forces men to perform the roles associated with the new gender order, which emphasizes the values of individualism, intensive consumption, and large investment in body and appearance. However, although young workers may want to shape their masculinity in such a way (and thus experience upward subjective social mobility), they also have restricted resources. Because of this, they often perceive themselves as 'unsuccessful' and experience habitual uncertainty. Nevertheless, they try to copy the lifestyle of the middle class and share some of their values. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Social class gradients have been explored in adults and children, but not extensively during adolescence. The first objective of this study was to examine the association between adolescent risk behaviors and a new indicator of adolescent relative social position, adolescent “perceived social mobility.” Second, it investigated potential underlying demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial determinants of this indicator. Data were taken from the 2004 urban adolescent module of Oportunidades, a cross-sectional study of Mexican adolescents living in poverty. Perceived social mobility was calculated for each subject by taking the difference between their rankings on two 10-rung ladder scales that measured (1) projected future social status and (2) current subjective social status within Mexican society. Adolescents with higher perceived social mobility were significantly less likely to report alcohol consumption, drinking with repercussions, compensated sex, police detainment, physical fighting, consumption of junk food or soda, or watching ≥4 h of television during the last viewing. They were significantly more likely to report exercising during the past week and using a condom during last sexual intercourse. These associations remained significant with the inclusion of covariates, including parental education and household expenditures. Multiple logistic regression analyses show higher perceived social mobility to be associated with staying in school longer and having higher perceived control. The present study provides evidence for the usefulness of perceived social mobility as an indicator for understanding the social gradient in health during adolescence. This research suggests the possibility of implementing policies and interventions that provide adolescents with real reasons to be hopeful about their trajectories. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We identify a fourth source: perceived social mobility. We argue that when people perceive a reasonable chance for upward mobility based on personal initiatives and efforts, the status quo becomes more justifiable because individuals are responsible for their own successes and failures. Perceived social mobility thus instills a sense of optimism and fairness and exonerates the regime from many blames, thereby enhancing political trust. Regression analysis of the China portion of the 2007 World Values Survey data shows that respondents who saw themselves as having choices and control in life were indeed more likely to trust the ruling communist party. The respondents' overall level of perceived social mobility is also high, which is consistent with the massive shake-up of the preexisting social order in China's reform era. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Profound changes are currently taking place in the United States in terms of how race, race relations and perceptions of social mobility are defined, perceived and understood. It is now the case that a majority of white Americans subscribe to a color-blind narrative of society where institutional racism has been eliminated and the American Creed of ‘racial equality for all’ has been achieved. The perception held by a majority of whites is that skin color is no longer the basis for discriminatory treatment, nor does race play a role in shaping socioeconomic mobility. White Americans can now point to President Barack Obama, the first black president of the United States, as proof that the goals of the civil rights movement of the 1960s have been achieved (Ludwig 2004). As many whites now see it, the United States has shifted from a country where race was the means by which all socioeconomic resources were allocated to a meritocractic country. This perspective, which I define as color-blind egalitarianism, is the tendency to claim that racial equality is now the norm, while simultaneously ignoring or discounting the real and ongoing ways in which institutional racism continues to disadvantage racial minorities. Color-blind egalitarianism reflects the fact that most whites, as expressed in national polling data, now view race as a benign social marker that has little or no bearing on an individual’s or group’s educational, economic or occupational mobility. This ‘leveled playing field’ perspective of society held by most whites is now the commonsense understanding of race relations, even though an extensive body of research documents how and in what ways institutional racism and racial discrimination continue to shape the life chances of racial minorities. In this chapter, I examine how color-blind racial egalitarianism came to dominate the narrative of race in the United States and the implications which this perspective holds for both race relations and the challenges which scholars face when they attempt to examine race-based social inequalities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Studies using logit models to answer the question posed in the present study show that the probability of success in life in Poland is determined by both ability and level of education; interview responses to the same question, however, show that family origins, parents' level of education and connections are just as important.

	abstract = {Latino immigrants exhibit health declines with increasing duration in the United States, which some attribute to a loss in social status after migration or downward social mobility. Yet, research into the distribution of perceived social mobility and patterned associations to Latino health is sparse, despite extensive research to show that economic and social advancement is a key driver of voluntary migration. We investigated Latino immigrant sub-ethnic group variation in the distribution of perceived social mobility, defined as the difference between respondents' perceived social status of origin had they remained in their country of origin and their current social status in the U.S. We also examined the association between perceived social mobility and past-year major depressive episode (MDE) and self-rated fair/poor physical health, and whether Latino sub-ethnicity moderated these associations. We computed weighted logistic regression analyses using the Latino immigrant subsample (N= 1561) of the National Latino and Asian American Study. Puerto Rican migrants were more likely to perceive downward social mobility relative to Mexican and Cuban immigrants who were more likely to perceive upward social mobility. Perceived downward social mobility was associated with increased odds of fair/poor physical health and MDE. Latino sub-ethnicity was a statistically significant moderator, such that perceived downward social mobility was associated with higher odds of MDE only among Puerto Rican and Other Latino immigrants. In contrast, perceived upward social mobility was not associated with self-rated fair/poor physical health. Our findings suggest that perceived downward social mobility might be an independent correlate of health among Latino immigrants, and might help explain Latino sub-ethnic group differences in mental health status. Future studies on Latino immigrant health should use prospective designs to examine the physiological and psychological costs associated with perceived changes in social status with integration into the U.S. mainland. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using a simple model of individual labor market participation under uncertainty, we predict that high levels of perceived fairness cause higher levels of individual welfare, and lower support for income redistribution. Income inequality is predicted to have a more favorable impact on subjective well-being for individuals with high fairness perceptions. This relationship is predicted to be stronger in societies that are characterized by low actual fairness. Using data on subjective well-being and a broad set of fairness measures from a pseudo micro-panel from the WVS over the 1990-2008 period, we find strong support for the negative (positive) association between fairness perceptions and the demand for more equal incomes (subjective well-being). We also find strong empirical support for the predicted differences in individual tolerance for income inequality, and the predicted influence of actual fairness. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The primary goals of the study were to examine: 1) the association between depression severity and sedentary behavior, weight status, and social integration, and 2) the moderating role of socio-demographic characteristics, and social integration, and perceived social mobility on the association between depression and sedentary behaviors. Methods: Three hundred and ninety-seven adults were recruited using multistage sampling methods and consented to complete a one-time interview and measurement of height and weight. The mean age was 43.4 ± 16.9, and 47% were obese. Results: Findings suggest that depression was positively associated with sedentary behaviors. Moreover, age and perceived social mobility moderated the relationship between depression and sedentary behavior. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are sedentary individuals at highest risk for developing depression. Sedentary individuals who were older or reported a lower social status were at highest risk for depression. Identifying these individuals in intervention programs that aim to reduce sedentary behavior and depression may enhance the effectiveness of these programs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper analyses the strategies for family participation in businesses through the narratives of foreign and returnee entrepreneurs in Galicia. The intersection between business and family has been a central theme in the literature on immigrant entrepreneurship, where 'family business' and 'immigrant business' are two synonymous concepts. This field of research has revealed that the use of female labour within business activity is a key factor in the success of the business, but that women's contribution to such success is largely invisible and their independence is hindered. On the other hand, the literature has studied how the participation of children in the business might impact negatively on their educational paths. This paper argues that women who run a business do not necessarily improve their opportunities for social and labour market integration or positive social mobility; and that the strategies by which children participate in the business is strongly linked to the parent's perception of social mobility. The differential access to citizenship for returnees and foreigners has an impact on the entrepreneurial strategies of both groups. The narratives analysed in this paper have been obtained through 74 semi-structured interviews with returnee and foreign immigrant entrepreneurs in Galicia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Framed by these policy initiatives and a critical look at widening participation in higher education, this paper reflects on the impacts of university learning on the self and the family among students with dependent children. With emphasis on, and differences highlighted between, male and female undergraduate students' own (often gendered) constructions of the impact of their university experiences and aspirations for social mobility, the paper suggests that while these students face numerous and varied barriers to their learning, they are motivated by the impact their studying will have on themselves and their families. Of notable significance is how higher education is perceived to reverberate within the home, promoting a culture of learning among, and encouraging the educational aspirations of, children. The paper concludes that this potential and perceived social mobility necessitates a bridging of the rhetoric of access with a reality of accessibility and retention for those students with caring responsibilities and offers a number of recommendations to encourage this. © 2010 Educational Review. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Sport-based social intervention programs are conceptualized as potential vehicles for the creation of different forms of capital from which certain benefits can be derived that enable social agents to improve their social position. While the Sport Steward Program has contributed to objective and subjective social mobility of some participants, in most cases it is more suitable to highlight the relatively modest increases in participants' cultural, social and/or economic capital. However, rather than simply enhancing individual freedom and opportunity, sport-based intervention programs also serve as a form of social control and regulation.

The ISSP Inequality-III surveys of 1999-2000 asked respondents to compare the status of their most recent job with the status of their father's job when the respondent was a teenager (N = 31,691 in thirty nations). On average, people thought they had moved up a moderate amount compared to their fathers, although women thought they had moved up less than men had. The actual gain in occupational status between father and offspring is an important influence on this subjective mobility (beta =27), but it is not the only influence. Two other changes also influenced subjective mobility: educational gains between parent and offspring, and countrywide gains in GDP between when the respondent was growing up and the present. Income and authority also matter. Subjective social mobility has important consequences, even controlling for actual social mobility, education, income, gender and authority. Those who think themselves mobile identify with a higher class subjectively, are more likely to think their pay is just, and believe they ought to earn high salaries. Thus, understanding subjective social mobility helps us to understand other aspects of society, especially attitudes towards inequality. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Subjective mobility is formalized quite differently in the two surveys, but so is objective mobility, which was formalized using specific procedures to make it comparable with respondents' subjective assessments. The present research note proposes a method for comparing the two sorts of mobility using standard mobility tables. When tables crossing three variables (social origins, social destinations, and average subjective mobility score) are used, the spontaneous sociology that collectively emerges from individual responses turns out to be not very different from scholarly sociology of social categories. After showing that subjective mobility varies coherently with objective mobility, an additional hypothesis is put forward to account for some of the observed discrepancies. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methods: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Tirana, the Albanian capital, in 2003-6. 467 non-fatal consecutive ACS patients were recruited (370 men aged 59.1 (SD 8.7) years and 97 women 63.3 (SD 7.1) years, 88% response). The control group comprised 469 men (53.1 (SD 10.4) years) and 268 women (54.0 (SD 10.9) years, 69% response). Information on the absolute financial loss (in US$), relative loss and subjective social mobility was obtained by a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Associations of financial loss and social mobility with ACS were assessed by multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Results: Financial loss in pyramid scams was frequent in both ACS patients (55%) and controls (41%). Downward subjective social mobility was noted in 31% of patients and 12% of controls. Upon adjustment for sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics and conventional coronary risk factors, ACS was associated with both financial loss (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.6) and downward social mobility (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.3). Although the association with financial loss was partly mediated through subjective social mobility, both maintained independent associations with ACS. Conclusions: In the wake of a nationwide catastrophic collapse of savings that led to losses totalling about 40% of the Albanian gross domestic product, the authors detected apparent long-term deleterious health effects of financial loss and downward intragenerational subjective social mobility. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.},

To examine these effects, this paper uses a data set of twins and a recently-developed econometric approach to show that within-family learning and family-specific effects are important determinants of voting preferences and preferences for redistribution. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These two surveys have formulated subjective mobility in quite different ways, but this observation also holds for objective mobility, which, for the purpose of comparison with respondents' subjective evaluations, is defined using specific procedures. A method is proposed for contrasting these two sorts of mobility based on classical mobility tables. When the latter are designed so as to cross three variables (social origins, destinations and average scores of subjective mobility), the spontaneous sociology that can be collectively detected in the assessments made by respondents turns out to be not very different from the scholarly sociology of social categories produced by sociologists. After showing that subjective and objective mobility vary coherently in relation to each other, an additional hypothesis is advanced to account for some discrepancies. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

	abstract = {The Social Indicators Project of the Development Academy of the Philippines (1974) aimed to formulate a measurement system capable of objectively depicting periodic changes in national development. It identified the following as basic Philippine social concerns: (1) Health and Nutrition, (2) Learning, (3) Income and Consumption, (4) Employment, (5) Non-human Productive Resources, (6) Housing, Utilities, and the Environment, (7) Public Safety and Justice, (8) Political Values, and (9) Social Mobility. This list is unique in considering political welfare. A multi-disciplinary research team selected 30 major indicators pertinent to these concerns. Although the majority are already encompassed by the Philippine statistical system, certain new indicators were proposed, including disability due to illness, human capital created by schooling, net beneficial product, families below a food threshold, an index of housing adequacy, an air pollution index for Greater Manila, an index of perceived public safety, indices of political mobility and efficacy, and indices of occupational mobility and perceived social mobility. A survey of 1000 households was used to demonstrate the feasibility of gathering needed new primary data, particularly those attitudinal in nature. An analysis of time series showed that certain aspects of Philippine welfare have been notably improving, but that others have been worsening; the direction of national progress can only be ascertained by admitting value-judgments on the relative importance of the several components of welfare. © 1977 D.
