AB  - Although previous investigations have agreed that Chinese rural-to-urban migrants' socioeconomic status (SES) increases with their migration, the association between SES and subjective well-being is uncertain. To address this research gap, the present study proposed that the association between objective SES and subjective well-being is mediated by subjective SES. This model was tested with a sample of 432 Chinese rural-to-urban migrants. The results indicate a significant association between objective SES and subjective well-being and a partial mediating effect of subjective SES. Furthermore, subjective social mobility, which is one's expectation about the possibility to move upward in the social hierarchy, was found to moderate both the direct path from objective SES to subjective well-being and the indirect path from subjective SES to subjective well-being. These findings suggest that Chinese rural-to-urban migrants gained in subjective well-being not only because of direct financial achievement but also because of their perceptions and beliefs about their relative social status.

AB  - One’s current socioeconomic position is intimately tied to one’s health status. Further, childhood living conditions also exert lasting effects on the health of adults. However, studies on changes in one’s socioeconomic position over the life course rarely find consistent and systematic effects of social mobility for individual health and wellbeing. Such studies almost exclusively draw on objective measures of social mobility and do not consider subjective appraisals of social mobility by individuals themselves. We conduct an analysis of cross-sectional, representative German survey data to explore the question as to how subjective perceptions as opposed to objective accounts of occupational status mobility affect five self-reported health and wellbeing outcomes differentially. We show that objective and subjective accounts of social mobility overlap, yet this association is far from perfect. Further, there are relatively small associations between objective and subjective mobility accounts and health outcomes. Associations between subjective mobility perceptions and health outcomes are intriguingly independent of objective social mobility trajectories. Mismatches between objective and subjective mobility are also correlated with some health outcomes. We discuss implications of our findings that social mobility is associated with those aspects of health which are more closely related to psychological wellbeing rather than physical health.

AB  - Despite decreasing intergenerational mobility, strengthening the ties between family background and children’s economic outcomes, Western citizens continue to believe in meritocracy. We study how meritocratic beliefs about success relate to individuals’ social mobility experiences: Is subjective upward mobility associated with meritocratic attributions of success and downward mobility with structuralist views? Whereas previous studies addressed the relevance of individuals’ current position or objective mobility, we leverage diagonal reference models to disentangle the role of subjective mobility, origin, and destination. Surveying a representative Dutch sample (n = 1,507), we find, echoing the Thomas theorem, that if people experience social mobility as real, it is real in its consequences: subjective upward mobility is associated with stronger meritocratic beliefs, and downward mobility is associated with stronger structuralist beliefs—but has no bearing on people’s meritocracy beliefs. This helps understand the muted political response to growing inequality: a small share of upwardly mobile individuals may suffice to uphold public faith in meritocracy.

AB  - Automated vehicles are expected to change the mobility landscape. Older adults living in both urban and peripheral areas may benefit from the availability of new automated modes due to increasing levels of accessibility. However, little is known about how seniors may make use of new automated mobility options. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to explore the mobility needs and desires of older adults in the province of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and assess how they envision the future usage of four distinct AV scenarios: automated public transport with fixed schedules, routes and timetables; automated on-demand public transport; fleet-based shared automated vehicles; and privately owned automated vehicles. Based on the results of a series of focus groups, findings demonstrate that study participants have a strong interest in using AVs in their daily life to overcome current accessibility and mobility barriers. Increases in flexibility due to on-demand booking, using the mode for access and egress to other modes of transport, as well as the option to travel together with friends were found to be important factors in having a positive attitude towards AV adoption. The findings of this study allow researchers, transport agencies and vehicle manufacturers to gain a broader understanding of the needs of older adults and take them into account in future AV design and policy development.

AB  - The question as to whether changing one's socioeconomic position over the life course affects health has not been answered in a conclusive manner. At the same time, it has been established that individuals who think of themselves that they are higher in the social hierarchy are healthier than those who think otherwise.In this study, we focus on perceived social mobility to shed new light on the issue of how social mobility affects health. We examine whether perceived social mobility, i.e., an individual's appraisal of doing better or worse than their parents, affects health by analyzing longitudinal data from Poland.Using a fixed effects approach to account for all time-invariant and important time-varying confounders, we analyze the Polish Panel Survey which has been collecting data on participants' social mobility perceptions along with information on their self-reported physical health and psychological wellbeing.We find that perceived social mobility is a significant predictor of self-reported physical health and psychological wellbeing, even in models that adjust for a host of theoretically relevant control variables. The results demonstrate that upward subjective mobility has a consistent and strong positive effect on health outcomes. The effect of perceived social mobility is stronger for males and for those with less advantageous social origins.Our findings are in line with the "from rags to riches" theoretical perspective, emphasizing the positive implications of upward social mobility on health through various psychological mechanisms. Based on our findings, we call for greater scholarly attention to subjective aspects of social mobility in research on health outcomes.

AB  - Body-worn, inertial sensors can provide many objective measures of balance and gait. However, the objective measures that best reflect patient perception of mobility disability and clinician assessment of Parkinson disease (PD) are unknown.The purposes of this study were: (1) to determine which objective measures of balance and gait are most related to patient perception of mobility disability and disease severity in people with PD and (2) to examine the effect of levodopa therapy on these correlates.This was an experimental correlation study.One hundred four people with idiopathic PD performed 3 trials of the Instrumented Stand and Walk Test (ISAW) in the "on" and "off" medication states. The ISAW consists of quiet standing (30 seconds), gait initiation, straight walking (7 m), and turning (180°), yielding 34 objective measures of mobility from body-worn inertial sensors. Patient perception of mobility disability was assessed with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and the mobility subscale of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Disease severity was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (motor UPDRS). Spearman correlations were used to relate objective measures of mobility to patient perception and disease severity.Turning speed, gait speed, and stride length were most highly correlated to severity of disease and patient perception of mobility disability. The objective measures of mobility in the off-medication state were more indicative of patient perception of mobility disability and balance confidence compared with on-medication state measures.Causation is an inherent problem of correlation studies.Physical therapists should evaluate mobility in people with PD in the off-medication state because the off-medication state is more related to disease severity and patient perception of mobility disability than the on-medication state mobility. Assessment and treatment of mobility in people with PD should target specific measures (ie, turning, gait speed, and stride length) because these measures best reflect patients' quality of life and balance confidence.

AB  - In this paper, we revisit the association between happiness and inequality. We argue that the interaction between the perceived and the actual fairness of the income generation process affects this association. Building on a simple model of individual labor-market participation under uncertainty, we predict that higher levels of perceived fairness cause higher levels of utility, and lower preferred levels of income redistribution. In societies with a low level of actual social mobility, income inequality is perceived more negatively with increased perceived fairness, due to the need for unexpected policy changes as a response to many unsuccessful investments of overly optimistic individuals. This effect becomes smaller as actual social mobility increases. Using data on happiness and a broad set of fairness measures from the World Values Survey, we find strong support for the negative (positive) association between fairness perceptions and the demand for more equal incomes (subjective wellbeing). We also find strong empirical support for the disappointment effect in countries with low social mobility. Consistent with our theoretical model, the results for high-mobility countries turn out to be ambiguous.

AB  - To compare walking test results with walking in daily life, and to investigate the relationships between walking tests, walking activity in daily life, and perceived mobility problems in patients with post-poliomyelitis syndrome.Twenty-four ambulant patients with post-poliomyelitis syndrome.Walking tests were performed at self-preferred and maximal speed. Walking activity was measured with an ambulatory activity monitor. Heart rate, step cadence and walking speed in the test and in daily life were compared. Walking speed in daily life was represented by the intensity of walking. Perceived mobility problems were assessed with the Nottingham Health Profile.Heart rate during walking was lower in the test at self-preferred speed than in daily life (mean difference: 11.3+/-10.4; p=0.001). Self-preferred walking speed in the test and in daily life correlated significantly (r=0.55; p=0.04). In a sub-group with a test performance below the median value, test performance correlated significantly with walking activity. No significant correlation was found between perceived mobility problems and walking activity.Walking in daily life may be more demanding than walking under standardized conditions. Patients with post-poliomyelitis syndrome with the lowest test performance walked less in daily life. Patients do not necessarily match their activity pattern to their perceived mobility problems.

AB  - This article explores the association between intergenerational social mobility and attitudes towards income differences in post-socialist societies. I hypothesise that based on the psychological mechanism of self-serving bias in causal attribution, those who experience upward social mobility are more likely to support greater income differences, and that subjective intergenerational mobility has stronger association with attitudes towards income differences than objective mobility because individuals filter their objective environment in order to derive their subjective perceptions of the world and their own experiences. The described hypotheses are tested with two cross-national data sets – European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings are robust to alternative statistical specifications and indicate that individuals who perceive themselves as subjectively mobile have significantly different attitudes towards income differences in comparison to non-mobile groups, but that this effect does not manifest among objectively mobile individuals.

AB  - Objectives To explore the associations between self‐reported hearing problems and physical performance and self‐reported difficulties in mobility and activities of daily living ( ADL s) in community‐dwelling older adults. Design Cross‐sectional cohort study. Setting Community. Participants Men and women aged 75 to 90 (N = 848). Measurements Structured face‐to‐face interviews to assess perceived hearing problems in the presence of noise, mobility difficulties (moving indoors, stair‐climbing, 0.5‐km walk, 2‐km walk), and difficulties in ADL s and instrumental ADL s. The Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) was administered. Age; years of education; cognitive functioning; and self‐reported cardiac, circulatory, and locomotor diseases were used as covariates. Results Persons who reported major hearing problems had a lower SPPB total score than those who reported good hearing (mean 9.8 vs 10.9, P = .009), indicating poorer performance, and more difficulties in ADL s (mean 1.8 vs 1.4, P = .002) and IADL s (mean 4.6 vs 3.4, P = .002), after controlling for covariates. They were also more likely to have more difficulty in stair‐climbing (odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.8, P &lt; .001) and walking 2 km ( OR = 2.1, P = .003) and tended to have more difficulty in walking 0.5 km ( OR = 1.7, P = .05) but not moving indoors ( P = .18). Persons who reported only some hearing problems did not differ from those who reported good hearing in any of the variables studied. Conclusion Perceived major hearing problems in older adults may contribute to poorer lower limb performance and difficulties in mobility and ADL s. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether poor hearing is a risk factor for decline in physical performance.

AB  - Abstract There is an increasing interest in the subjective aspect of socioeconomic position and its implications for wellbeing across social science disciplines. One of the emerging dimensions of this scholarship is research on perceived social mobility, its determinants, and consequences. To date, most existing evidence in this area is based on cross-sectional data and corresponding methods, which are biased by the unobserved heterogeneity of individuals. The latter calls into question existing findings on the nature of perceived social mobility. To provide more robust estimates of trends over time and explanations of perceived social mobility, we explore two complementary datasets covering the period between the late 1990s and the late 2010s in Poland. Due to the major economic, political and social changes, exploring subjective perceptions of intergenerational mobility might be particularly important in post-communist settings. The analysis allows us to conclude that, over the last two decades, significant changes in perceived social mobility have taken place in Poland. In terms of the individual-level predictors of this trend, cross-sectional and random-effects analyses over-estimate the importance of certain characteristics, such as age, education, or size of locality, yet, based on the results from more robust fixed-effects estimates, we conclude that factors such as subjective social position, household income, and objective social mobility are important explanations as to why some people believe they are doing better or worse than their parents.

AB  - <h3>BACKGROUND:</h3> Although routine physical activity for individuals with COPD is recommended, there are inherent limitations of available oxygen delivery devices that may result in hypoxemia during activity. Changes in Medicare laws have resulted in an increased use of oxygen cylinders and a reduction in the use of liquid oxygen devices. The aim of this survey was to assess the impact of perceived satisfaction with various oxygen delivery devices on perceived mobility and quality of life (QOL) of oxygen-dependent subjects with COPD. <h3>METHODS:</h3> A survey was developed to measure perceived satisfaction with current portable oxygen delivery devices, perceived mobility, and perceived QOL. The survey was deployed via a link posted on the COPD Foundation9s COPD360SOCIAL social media site for 5 weeks, which resulted in the recruitment of 529 participants, of which 417 were included in the data analysis. <h3>RESULTS:</h3> Quantile regression analysis revealed that the median perceived device satisfaction score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) compared with the portable oxygen cylinder and portable oxygen concentrator (POC) groups. The median perceived mobility score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) compared with the portable oxygen cylinder group, but not the POC group. The median QOL score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) compared with the POC and portable oxygen cylinder groups. Moreover, partial least-squares structural equation modeling regression analysis showed that perceived mobility is significantly affected by perceived satisfaction with the long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) device (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.15, <i>P</i> &lt; .001), and perceived QOL is significantly affected by both perceived satisfaction with the LTOT device and perceived mobility (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.45, <i>P</i> &lt; .001). <h3>CONCLUSIONS:</h3> For individuals with COPD requiring LTOT, perceived satisfaction with a portable LTOT device significantly and positively affects perceived mobility and QOL.

AB  - One’s current socioeconomic position is intimately tied to one’s health status. Further, childhood living conditions also exert lasting effects on the health of adults. However, studies on changes in one’s socioeconomic position over the life course rarely find important effects of social mobility for individual health and wellbeing. Such studies always draw on objective measures of social mobility and do not consider subjective appraisals of social mobility by individuals themselves. Using cross-sectional, representative German survey data, we explore the question as to how subjective perceptions as opposed to objective accounts of occupational status mobility affect five self-reported health and wellbeing outcomes differently. We show that objective and subjective accounts of social mobility overlap, yet this association is far from perfect. Further, there are relatively small associations between objective and subjective mobility accounts and health outcomes. Associations between subjective mobility perceptions and health outcomes are intriguingly independent of objective social mobility trajectories. Mismatches between objective and subjective mobility are also correlated with some health outcomes. We discuss implications of our finding that social mobility is associated with those aspects of health which are more closely related to psychological wellbeing rather than physical health.

AB  - Background . Stroke is a leading cause for long-term disability that often compromises the sensorimotor and gait function accompanied by spasticity. Gait abnormalities persist through the chronic stages of the condition and only a small percentage of these persons are able to walk functionally in the community. Material and Method . Patients with chronic stroke were recruited from outpatient rehabilitation unit at Department of Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, having a history of first stroke at least six months before recruitment, with unilateral motor deficits affecting gait. The patients were randomly assigned to either the functional limb overloading (FLO) or Limb Overloading Resistance Training (LORT) group and provided four weeks of training. Result . We found that there was an improvement in gait performance, weight bearing on affected limb, and perceived mobility and community participation. Conclusion . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has evaluated the effects of functional limb overloading training on symmetric weight bearing, walking ability, and perceived mobility and participation in chronic hemiplegic population. The study demonstrated a beneficial effect of training on all the outcomes, suggesting that the functional limb overloading training can be a useful tool in the management of gait problems in chronic stroke patients.

AB  - Little scholarly attention has been paid to the relationship between children's subjective social mobility and their "social ecology". Children's subjective social mobility is about how they perceive their future social position compared to their parents'. Social ecology refers to the influential multi-layered surrounding factors, including family, school, and community. We analyzed data from structured questionnaires completed by 2221 migrant children (1296 boys and 925 girls, with a mean age of 11.7 years) from three private schools in Guangzhou and Foshan, China. The findings indicate that participants anticipated a significant improvement in their future social status. Of the factors influencing this belief, community integration has the most significant impact (TE = 0.246), followed by school integration (TE = 0.220) and family socioeconomic status (TE = 0.053). We also found that children's self-concept plays a role in their perceptions of social mobility. Based on the study results, we propose recommendations to provide migrant children additional protection and enhance their living environment.

AB  - In this paper, we revisit the association between happiness and inequality. We argue that the interaction between the perceived and the actual fairness of the income generation process affects this association. Building on a simple model of individual labor-market participation under uncertainty, we predict that higher levels of perceived fairness cause higher levels of utility, and lower preferred levels of income redistribution. In societies with a low level of actual social mobility, income inequality is perceived more negatively with increased perceived fairness, due to the need for unexpected policy changes as a response to many unsuccessful investments of overly optimistic individuals. This effect becomes smaller as actual social mobility increases. Using data on happiness and a broad set of fairness measures from the World Values Survey, we find strong support for the negative (positive) association between fairness perceptions and the demand for more equal incomes (subjective wellbeing). We also find strong empirical support for the disappointment effect in countries with low social mobility. Consistent with our theoretical model, the results for high-mobility countries turn out to be ambiguous.

AB  - In the context of rapid social change, the perception of social stratification has far-reaching and complex influences on human psychology and behavior, including citizen participation. The current research explored the interactive influence of social status and subjective social mobility on citizen participation. Two studies used experimental methods to manipulate subjective social mobility and social status, respectively, to examine the interactive effect. Taken together, the results of both studies revealed that the interaction between social status and subjective social mobility had a significant influence on citizen participation: whereas citizen participation with high social status was not affected by subjective social mobility, citizen participation with low social status decreased with increases in subjective social mobility. This research established a combined dynamic and static analysis framework of social stratification structure, elucidating the current status of citizen participation under the influence of the interaction between social status and subjective social mobility, and providing a countermeasure reference for effectively promoting citizen participation.

AB  - Using American General Social Survey data from 1994 to 2018, this paper examines how Americans of different racial backgrounds perceive their past intergenerational mobility and their, and their children’s, prospects for future mobility, before, during, and after Barack Obama’s presidency. We find that White Americans are generally less positive than Black and Latinx Americans about mobility, especially their children’s mobility prospects. However, racial gaps in optimism widened considerably during the Obama presidency, due to a significant decline in White respondents’ perceived mobility. A more detailed analysis of White respondents’ views by levels of racial resentment and political partisanship shows that the Obama-era dip among White respondents is concentrated among those who are racially resentful and among Republican voters, two groups that substantially overlap. For these two groups, perceived future prospects for their and their children’s mobility increased again during the Trump administration. Black and Latinx respondents’ perceptions of mobility are stable across all earlier presidential administrations, but decline somewhat with the Trump presidency.

AB  - We argue that perceived fairness of the income generation process affects the association between income inequality and subjective well-being, and that there are systematic differences in this regard between countries that are characterized by a high or, respectively, low level of actual fairness. Using a simple model of individual labor market participation under uncertainty, we predict that high levels of perceived fairness cause higher levels of individual welfare, and lower support for income redistribution. Income inequality is predicted to have a more favorable impact on subjective wellbeing for individuals with high fairness perceptions. This relationship is predicted to be stronger in societies that are characterized by low actual fairness. Using data on subjective well-being and a broad set of fairness measures from a pseudo micro-panel from the WVS over the 1990-2008 period, we find strong support for the negative (positive) association between fairness perceptions and the demand for more equal incomes (subjective well-being). We also find strong empirical support for the predicted differences in individual tolerance for income inequality, and the predicted influence of actual fairness.

AB  - Abstract Despite the high prevalence of sexual objectification, the understanding of gender differences in its victimization and perpetration remains limited. We bridged victim and perpetrator perspectives, expecting that objectification victimization positively predicts perpetration, and investigated the mediating role of social dominance orientation (SDO), and gender and perceived social mobility as moderators. Participants (valid N = 530) completed measures of sexual objectification victimization, perceived social mobility, SDO, and sexual objectification perpetration. We found that sexual objectification victimization predicted its perpetration, and that this relationship was stronger among men than women. SDO partially mediated the moderation effect of gender, whereby mediation through SDO was significant among men, but not significant among women. Moreover, a three-way interaction between sexual objectification victimization, gender, and perceived social mobility predicted SDO and carried subsequent implications for sexual objectification perpetration. Despite the mediation effect through SDO not achieving significance among women, it was significantly moderated by perceived social mobility. Specifically, the indirect effect among women with high perceived social mobility was significantly different than that among women with low perceived social mobility, but not significantly different than that among men, whose results were not influenced by perceived social mobility. This study provides a more nuanced understanding of gender in sexual objectification—specifically that gender differences may be related to social power and differences in socialization. The findings offer implications for the development of theories and clinical programs for coping with objectification victimization and preventing perpetration.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine and reflect on the mobility of ideas between multinational corporation (MNC) headquarters and subsidiaries. Does it always represent (positively perceived) knowledge transfer or can it sometimes constitute (negatively perceived) intra-corporate plagiarism? What are antecedents and consequences of negatively perceived mobility of ideas? Design/methodology/approach The authors conceptualise inter-unit knowledge transfer in MNCs without recognition of originators as an act of intra-corporate plagiarism. The conceptualisation is informed by theoretical perspectives in the literature and indicative data emerging unexpectedly from a study designed to examine knowledge transfer in MNCs. These illustrate the concept, point to factors affecting the propensity to plagiarise, and provide preliminary insight on both negative and positive consequences. Aiming to build theory, the authors offer propositions for further research. Findings The conceptualisation suggests that adopting units lose access to the original sources of ideas as plagiarism victims may establish defensive strategies. Originators of ideas may experience loss of trust, be unsupportive of implementation and erect barriers to future mobility. There is risk of reputation loss and rejection of ideas and practices from other units. However, the conceptualisation also suggests that, ironically and counterintuitively, plagiarism may increase the mobility of ideas within MNCs. Research limitations/implications The authors do not test hypotheses and make no claims from the data about statistical validity or prevalence of the phenomenon. As the emergent data are not longitudinal, and specific to human resource management practices, the authors cannot empirically establish all antecedents and consequences of intra-corporate plagiarism. Hence, the theorisations primarily rely on perspectives in the literature. The study merely offers the theoretical conceptualisation of the phenomenon and propositions for future research. Practical implications Drawing on theoretical perspectives in the literature at the country level (ethnocentrism, dominance effects, legitimacy, capability) and organisation level (not-invented-here syndrome, micro-politics), the study indicates consequences that MNCs may wish to consider in their knowledge management. Originality/value The first contribution is the conceptualisation of inter-unit knowledge transfer in MNCs without recognition of originators as an act of intra-corporate plagiarism. Second, the authors point out that knowledge transfer directionality reported in other research may be based on intentional or unintentional misrepresentation. Third, the authors theorise intra-corporate plagiarism as potentially useful in mitigating ethnocentrism, country-of-origin dominance effects and perceptions about legitimacy and capability.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate outdoor mobility of immigrants in Sweden who are living with the late effects of polio.Materials and methods: A total of 145 patients with late effects of polio born outside the Nordic region were identified at an outpatient polio clinic. Of these, 74 completed a questionnaire about their mobility and independence in daily life, self-perceived pain and depression, vocational status, mobility assistive devices/aids, transportation modes and driving. Patient characteristics were based on medical records supplied by physicians.Results: Twice as many patients had lower extremities that were affected by polio than upper extremities. This affected their use of different transport modes and caused mobility and transfer problems. Indeed, 39% needed mobility aids and help from another person to move outdoors. Those who reported dependence for outdoor mobility were more often unemployed and more often depressed.Conclusions: Many respondents reported having difficulties with transport mobility, but a large proportion, 57%, were independent and active drivers. It is important to consider outdoor mobility when planning rehabilitation for patients with late effects of polio and foreign backgrounds. In addition to psychosocial factors, dependence on mobility-related activities can lead to dependency and isolation.Implications for rehabilitationOutdoor mobility and access to transport modes are important for independence and an active life and need to be included in the rehabilitation process.Both personal and environmental factors, can contribute to mobility problems of people with foreign backgrounds, who are living with the late effects of polio.Factors such as cultural, social and gender aspects are important when planning suitable and individualized rehabilitation.

AB  - Falls are a frequent and costly concern for lower limb prosthesis (LLP) users. At present, there are no models that clinicians can use to predict the incidence of future falls in LLP users. Assessing who is at risk for falls, therefore, remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to test whether easily accessible clinical attributes and measurements predict the incidence of future falls in LLP users.In this prospective observational study, a secondary analysis of data from 60 LLP users was conducted. LLP users reported the number of falls that they recalled over the past year before prospectively reporting falls over a 6-month observation period via monthly telephone calls. Additional candidate predictor variables were recorded at baseline. Negative binomial regression was used to develop a model intended to predict the incidence of future falls.The final model, which included the number of recalled falls (incidence rate ratio = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.28) and Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility T-scores (incidence rate ratio = 0.949; 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.01), was significantly better than a null model at predicting the number of falls over the next 6 months (χ22 = 9.76) and fit the observed prospective fall count data (χ256 = 54.78).The number of recalled falls and Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility T-scores predicted the incidence of falls over the next 6 months in established, unilateral LLP users. The success and simplicity of the final model suggests that it may serve as a screening tool for clinicians to use for assessing risk of falls. Additional research to validate the proposed model in an independent sample of LLP users is needed.Owing to its simplicity, the final model may serve as a suitable screening measure for clinicians to ascertain an initial evaluation of fall risk in established unilateral LLP users. Analyzing falls data as counts rather than as a categorical variable may be an important methodological consideration for falls prevention research.

AB  - Abstract Background Changes in the subjective social status (SSS) of migrants, specifically between the pre- and post-migratory movement, can be a relevant determinant of their mental health condition. This study analyzed the effect of downward subjective social mobility to the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees (ASR) in Germany. Methods Through a random sampling procedure, 560 adult ASR (18+ years) were recruited across 58 collective accommodation centers in Germanys' 3rd largest state (2018). SSS was assessed with the MacArthur social ladder (10-rungs), in reference to the participants' position in the country of origin and in Germany. Quality of Life (QoL, measured with EUROHIS-QOL), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-2) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), were considered as mental health outcomes. Generalized linear regression models were fitted to measure associations between changes in SSS and each outcome. Results A loss of 3 or more steps in SSS from origin to Germany (compared to no-change) was significantly associated with poorer scores in QoL (B, standardized coefficient= -2.679, standard error, se = 1.351, p = 0.047), with more symptoms of depression (B = 1.156, se = 0.389, p = 0.003) and anxiety (B = 0.971, se = 0.432, p = 0.025), in models adjusted for SSS in the country of origin. The strength and direction of associations was unaltered after further adjusting for sex, age, educational level and time since arrival, although the coefficient for QoL was non-significant for those declaring a 3-step downward mobility (B= -2.494, se = 1.351, p = 0.066 for QoL; B = 1.048, se = 0.393, p = 0.008 for depression; and B = 1.006, se = 0.438, p = 0.022 for anxiety). Discussion The results suggest that interventions should focus on those experiencing social downward mobility and not only prioritize individuals with low social status. Early integration efforts and intersectoral measures to counter social downward mobility could prevent poor mental health among ASR. Key messages We analysed the impact to the quality of life and mental health of asylum seekers and refugees, of a change in subjective social status from country of origin to Germany. Asylum seekers and refugees residing in Germany, who perceived a downward social status mobility following their migration process, are at risk for poorer mental health.

AB  - Abstract While research on conspicuous consumption has typically analyzed how people spend money on products that signal status, this article investigates conspicuous consumption in relation to time. The authors argue that a busy and overworked lifestyle, rather than a leisurely lifestyle, has become an aspirational status symbol. A series of studies shows that the positive inferences of status in response to busyness and lack of leisure time are driven by the perceptions that a busy person possesses desired human capital characteristics (e.g., competence and ambition) and is scarce and in demand in the job market. This research uncovers an alternative kind of conspicuous consumption that operates by shifting the focus from the preciousness and scarcity of goods to the preciousness and scarcity of individuals. Furthermore, the authors examine cultural values (perceived social mobility) and differences among cultures (North America vs. Europe) to demonstrate moderators and boundary conditions of the positive associations derived from signals of busyness.

AB  - People's motivation to rationalize and defend the status quo is a major barrier to societal change. Three studies tested whether perceived social mobility - beliefs about the likelihood to move up and down the socioeconomic ladder - can condition people's tendency to engage in system justification. Compared to information suggesting moderate social mobility, exposure to low social-mobility frames consistently reduced defense of the overarching societal system. Two studies examined how this effect occurs. Compared to moderate or baseline conditions, a low social-mobility frame reduced people's endorsement of (typically strong) meritocratic and just-world beliefs, which in turn explained lower system defense. These effects occurred for political liberals, moderates, and conservatives, and could not be explained by other system-legitimizing ideologies or people's beliefs about their own social mobility. Implications for societal change programs are discussed.

AB  - Social class gradients have been explored in adults and children, but not extensively during adolescence. The first objective of this study was to examine the association between adolescent risk behaviors and a new indicator of adolescent relative social position, adolescent "perceived social mobility." Second, it investigated potential underlying demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial determinants of this indicator. Data were taken from the 2004 urban adolescent module of Oportunidades, a cross-sectional study of Mexican adolescents living in poverty. Perceived social mobility was calculated for each subject by taking the difference between their rankings on two 10-rung ladder scales that measured (1) projected future social status and (2) current subjective social status within Mexican society. Adolescents with higher perceived social mobility were significantly less likely to report alcohol consumption, drinking with repercussions, compensated sex, police detainment, physical fighting, consumption of junk food or soda, or watching ≥4 h of television during the last viewing. They were significantly more likely to report exercising during the past week and using a condom during last sexual intercourse. These associations remained significant with the inclusion of covariates, including parental education and household expenditures. Multiple logistic regression analyses show higher perceived social mobility to be associated with staying in school longer and having higher perceived control. The present study provides evidence for the usefulness of perceived social mobility as an indicator for understanding the social gradient in health during adolescence. This research suggests the possibility of implementing policies and interventions that provide adolescents with real reasons to be hopeful about their trajectories.

AB  - Increasing the share of battery electric vehicles (BEV) in the total car fleet is regarded as a promising way to reduce local car emissions. Based on online surveys in Denmark and Sweden, this study compares BEV users' (n = 673) and conventional vehicle (CV) users' (n = 1794) socio-demographic profiles, attitudinal profiles, and mobility patterns. In line with previous research, BEV users are typically male, highly educated, have high incomes, and often more than one car in their household. Additionally, BEV users perceive less functional barriers toward BEV use and have more positive attitudes and norms than CV users. The different profiles of these user groups suggest a separate analysis of potential factors of BEV adoption in both groups. In regression analyses, CV and BEV users' intention to use/purchase a BEV is modeled based on factors of the Theory of Planned Behavior extended by personal norm, perceived mobility necessities, and BEV experience. For CV users, symbolic attitudes related to BEVs are the most important factor of intention, while perceived functional barriers in terms of driving range are most relevant for BEV users' intention. How BEV users cope with trips of longer distance seems of particular relevance. In multiple car households, we found the percentage of actual BEV usage related to the type of other cars in the household, perceived functional barriers of BEVs as well as (successful) behavioral adaption to longer trips by BEVs. Based on the results, we discuss ways to increase BEV adoption for current users and non-users.

AB  - The consequences of changing one's socio-economic status over the life course—i.e. social mobility—for individual health are not well understood. Theories of the health implications of social mobility draw on the human perception of one's changing conditions, but empirical studies mostly examine the health implications of moving from objectively defined indicators of parental socio-economic position such as education, occupation, or income, to own socio-economic position in adult life. Little is known about the consequences of individuals' own assessment of changes in socio-economic position for health outcomes. In this study, we examine the association of social mobility and health in a unique sample of the Russian population after the transition to a market society. We take a broad perspective on social mobility, putting emphasis on subjectively perceived social mobility. Results show that individuals' objective characteristics only partially explain the variation in their subjective perceptions of intergenerational mobility. Net of social origin and destination variables, subjective social mobility is associated with individuals' health outcomes, as measured by the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Those who perceive being upwardly mobile report better health, and downward mobility is associated with poorer health. The association holds for mental and physical health, for perceived downward and upward social mobility, and for a general subjective measure of mobility and a subjective measure prompting respondents to only think of mobility in terms of occupation. These findings are robust to controlling for a rich set of socio-demographic predictors on childhood adversity, contemporaneous material wellbeing, and family-related circumstances. We conclude that a conventional focus on single socio-economic status dimensions such as occupation might be too narrow to capture the health consequences of social mobility.

AB  - This study aims to explore university students’ intention to use mobile learning management systems (m-LMS) in higher education in Sweden. To address this, a research model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and nine research hypotheses are developed. In addition to perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use from the TAM, the research model includes academic relevance, university management support and perceived mobility value from previous literature as external variables to study the adoption of m-LMS. The proposed research model and research hypotheses are empirically tested with 130 university students in Sweden. According to the results, support is found for seven of the nine research hypotheses. This study contributes to the validation of the extended TAM for mobile learning and demonstrates the hypothesised model moderately predicts students’ intention to adopt m-LMS in higher education in Sweden.

AB  - The world witnessed a rapid growth in the e-commerce in the recent years. Widespread use of mobile devices in the e-commerce has a role in this augmentation. Associated with growth of trading volume and the introduction of new devices, new products and solutions emerge and they diversify concerning online payments. Consumer attitudes and behaviors may change according to these developments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors effecting adoption of mobile payment systems by the consumer. 225 individuals were surveyed online through convenience sampling method. A research model was developed and proposed relationships were tested using structural equation modeling. The empirical findings point out that perceived trust, perceived mobility and attitudes positively affect the adoption of MPS; perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have no effect on adoption of MPS. Furthermore perceived reputation positively related to perceived trust and finally environmental risk negatively related to perceived trust.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This study aims to investigate the impact of perceived downward mobility on populist attitudes. Intergenerational downward mobility breaks the promise that new generations should meet the living standards of their parents, a crucial component of the order and political legitimacy of the postwar decades in high‐income democracies. We argue that this frustrated expectation fuels populism. Methods We use data from a cross‐national survey conducted in eight European countries in the aftermath of the Great Recession. The survey includes a valid and reliable measure of populist attitudes and a measure of perceived social mobility. Results Results show a direct effect of perceived downward mobility on populist attitudes. The relationship is robust to different controls and consistent across the eight countries. We also find that socioeconomic factors moderate this relationship due to diverse expectations of social mobility and the different appeal that the populist discourse generates among various social groups. Conclusions These findings refine the literature on the socioeconomics of populism by nuancing the established connection between low educational attainment, socioeconomic factors and populist attitudes. The article also contributes to the literature on the consequences of downward mobility.

AB  - ABSTRACT Commuting is popularly viewed as a stressful, costly, time‐wasting experience from the individual perspective, with the attendant congestion imposing major social costs as well. However, several authors have noted that commuting can also offer benefits to the individual, serving as a valued transition between the home and work realms of personal life. Using survey data collected from about 1,300 commuting workers in three San Francisco Bay Area neighborhoods, empirical models are developed for four key variables measured for commute travel, namely: Objective Mobility, Subjective Mobility, Travel Liking, and Relative Desired Mobility. Explanatory variables include measures of general travel‐related attitudes, personality traits, lifestyle priorities, and sociodemographic characteristics. Both descriptive statistics and analytical models indicate that commuting is not the unmitigated burden that it is widely perceived to be. About half of the sample were relatively satisfied with the amount they commute, with a small segment actually wanting to increase that amount. Both the psychological impact of commuting, and the amounts people want to commute relative to what they are doing now, are strongly influenced by their liking for commuting. An implication for policy is that some people may be more resistant than expected toward approaches intended to induce reductions in commuting (including, for example, telecommuting). New creativity may be needed to devise policies that recognize the inherent positive utility of travel, while trying to find socially beneficial ways to fulfill desires to maintain or increase travel.

AB  - With respect to information management, most of the previous studies on the acceptance of healthcare information technologies were analyzed from "positive" perspectives. However, such acceptance is always influenced by both positive and negative factors and it is necessary to validate both in order to get a complete understanding. This study aims to explore physicians' acceptance of mobile electronic medical records based on the dual-factor model, which is comprised of inhibitors and enablers, to explain an individual's technology usage. Following an earlier healthcare study in the USA, the researchers conducted a similar survey for an Eastern country (Taiwan) to validate whether perceived threat to professional autonomy acts as a critical inhibitor. In addition, perceived mobility, which is regarded as a critical feature of mobile services, was also evaluated as a common antecedent variable in the model. Physicians from three branch hospitals of a medical group were invited to participate and complete questionnaires. Partial least squares, a structural equation modeling technique, was used to evaluate the proposed model for explanatory power and hypotheses testing. 158 valid questionnaires were collected, yielding a response rate of 33.40%. As expected, the inhibitor of perceived threat has a significant impact on the physicians' perceptions of usefulness as well as their intention to use. The enablers of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were also significant. In addition, as expected, perceived mobility was confirmed to have a significant impact on perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived threat. It was confirmed that the dual-factor model is a comprehensive method for exploring the acceptance of healthcare information technologies, both in Western and Eastern countries. Furthermore, perceived mobility was proven to be an effective antecedent variable in the model. The researchers believe that the results of this study will contribute to the research on the acceptance of healthcare information technologies, particularly with regards to mobile electronic medical records, based on the dual-factor viewpoints of academia and practice.

AB  - Ample evidence implicates cellular senescence as a contributor to frailty and functional decline in rodents, but considerable effort remains to translate these findings to human aging.We quantified senescence biomarker p16INK4a-expressing cells in thigh adipose tissue obtained from older women previously enrolled in a 5-month resistance training intervention, with or without caloric restriction (RT ± CR, n = 11 baseline, 8 pre-post-intervention pairs). Women in this subsample were older (72.9 ± 3.4 y) and overweight/obese (body mass index: 30.6 ± 2.4 kg/m2). p16INK4a+ cells were identified from 12 to 20 random visual fields/sample at 20× magnification (immunohistochemical, nuclear staining) and were present in all adipose samples.Cross-sectional associations were observed between p16INK4a+ cell burden and physical function, including grip strength (r = -0.74), 400-m walk time (r = 0.74), 4-m gait speed (r = -0.73), and self-perceived mobility (r = -0.78) (p ≤ .05). These relationships remained significant after independent adjustments for age and adiposity (p ≤ .05). p16INK4a+ cell abundance was lower following the intervention (pre: 5.47 ± 3.4%, post: 2.17 ± 1.1% count p16INK4a+ cells, p ≤ .05).These results provide proof-of-concept that p16INK4a+ cells in thigh adipose are associated with physical function, and may be sensitive to change with RT ± CR in overweight/obese older women.

AB  - Objectives . For rehabilitation professionals to adequately address meaningful participation in social activities with their patients after a stroke, there must be a better understanding of neurobehavior, that is, how neurological impairment and its sequelae and environmental factors support or limit social participation. The current study examines how stroke severity (NIH Stroke Scale), its impact on perceived mobility (Stroke Impact Scale mobility domain), and the environment (MOS Social Support–Positive Social Interactions scale and Measure of Stroke Environment receptivity and built environment domains) influence social participation (Activity Card Sort: ACS). Methods . A correlational, cross-sectional design examined the relationships among neurological impairment, perceived limitations in activity, environmental factors, and social participation. Participants included 48 individuals who were at least 6 months post-stroke both with aphasia (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>22</mml:mn></mml:math>) and without aphasia (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M2"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>26</mml:mn></mml:math>) living in the community for whom all measures were available for analysis. Results . No differences in social participation were found between those with and without aphasia, though both groups reported a large (25-30%) decline in participating in their prestroke social activities. For the ACS Social Domain activities and ACS Partner to Do With activities (percent retained), 37% and 35% of the variance, respectively, was accounted for by the predictor variables, with only MOS Social Support making an independent contribution to social participation. In this sample, neurological impairment was not a significant correlate of social participation. Additionally, perceived mobility and the built environment were not found to independently predict participation in social activities. Conclusions . Perceived social support was found to predict social participation in individuals living in the community 6 months or greater post-stroke. Focusing on social support during post-stroke rehabilitation may provide an avenue for increased social participation and more successful community reintegration.

AB  - To offer an integrative account bridging individuals’ sociocultural orientations with pro‐environmentalism, the current research tested the mediating and moderating relationships among pro‐environmental intentions and three person‐level factors: perceived social mobility, cosmopolitan orientation, and social dominance orientation (SDO). With a Singaporean college student sample ( N = 220), we found support for the hypothesized second‐stage moderation model that perceived social mobility positively predicts cosmopolitan orientation, and in turn, cosmopolitan orientation is moderated by SDO to positively predict pro‐environmental intentions. Specifically, lower levels of SDO strengthen the pro‐environmental advantages of endorsing higher levels of cosmopolitan orientation. These findings add novel knowledge to the environmental psychology literature by advancing an integrative approach that demonstrates how the interplay of people's perceptions about the social, cultural, and group standing impacts their likelihood to engage in pro‐environmental actions. We discuss the implications that an egalitarian worldview toward other cultures, social groups, and human–nature relations might be the key to addressing the global challenge of climate change.

AB  - Background Long-term disability following stroke can lead to participation restrictions in complex and social everyday activities, yet information is lacking on to what extent stroke survivors return to their pre-stroke levels of participation. Objectives The objectives of this study were to investigate the level of participation in complex and social everyday activities 6 years after stroke, to compare this with pre-stroke participation and to identify predictors of returning to pre-stroke levels of participation. Method All patients admitted to Karolinska University Hospital's stroke units during a 1-year period were eligible to participate and 349 patients were recruited. Assessments were made at base-line, 3 months and 6 years using self-reported outcome measures. Participation was assessed using the Frenchay Activities Index (FAI). The 6-year score for each participant was compared to the pre-stroke score, both for the total score and for each domain (domestic chores, leisure/work and outdoor activities). Predictors of having the same or better level of participation at 6 years were identified using logistic regression. Results At 6 years, 121 participants were followed up, 166 were deceased, 44 declined to take part and 18 could not be traced. At 6 years 84% could be described as active (FAI≥15). The same level of participation or better than pre-stroke was found in 35% of participants, in 65% the level was lower. Similar predictors were identified for achieving the same or better level of participation at 6 years for FAI total and the three domains; ability to walk without aids and a lower age at stroke onset, and perceived mobility, participation and recovery at 3 months. Conclusion Six years after stroke, 35% of participants had the same or better level of participation as pre-stroke. Rehabilitation after stroke to improve walking ability and participation might improve long-term participation in complex and social everyday activities.

AB  - Attracting citizens and facilitating their continued usage is critical for the sustainable development of mobile government microblog services. Drawing on the stimulus–organism–response (SOR) framework and the literature related to perceived value, this study investigates the factors that affect citizens’ continuance intention vis-a-vis mobile government microblogs from a value-based perspective. A structural equation modeling (SEM)-neural network combined method was used to test the proposed model by using data collected from 301 mobile government microblog users in China. The SEM analysis shows that social influence, perceived interactivity, and perceived mobility positively affect citizens’ utilitarian value and hedonic value, which further affects their continuance intention. The significant factors obtained from the SEM are used as input for a neural network analysis to calculate their relative impacts. The results of the neural network analysis showed that perceived mobility is the most important factor influencing utilitarian value, while social influence is the most significant factor affecting hedonic value. The normalized importance of utilitarian value on continuance behaviors is larger than that of hedonic value.

AB  - Disability is a concept that grows as we think about it, forcing us to adjust our conversations in vocabulary and rhetoric depending on which disability world we inhabit or address. Understanding disability starts with exposure to disabled people’s bodyminds in their own spacetime and an appreciation of disability expertise. The disability justice movement pulls the intersectional performance of disability out of the intimate sphere so that it can play a role in policy, an analytic where anthropology should shine. This article is particularly addressed to anthropologists with a new interest in disability and critical disability studies scholars with a frustration with anthropology. I use exemplary analysis of actual dialogues drawn from an autoethnographic record of my own perceived mobility and speech impairments to explore my biopolitical positioning as disabled. Anthropologists have the capacity to move disability theory forward, feeding it with ethnographic fuel. While the anthropology of disability uses insightful ethnographic methods to understand specific impairments in specific contexts, the reflexive turn in anthropology has not yet embraced disability. We are still better off remaining individual disability experts; our collective efforts are still an “embarrassment to power.” This article, as part of a collective special issue, aims to change that.

AB  - The Perceived Mobility Need Satisfaction (PMNS) scale is a psychometric instrument that can be used to assess the perception of need satisfaction through a mobility resource. The scale was developed based on the scientific work of Sheldon et al. (2001) and aims to measure seven key components of mobility need satisfaction: Autonomy, competence, relatedness, safety, money, physical well-being and pleasure. By assessing these dimensions, the PMNS scale provides insight into how individuals perceive their experience of mobility in different contexts, such as on-demand ridepooling. Focusing on individual experiences and psychological needs, the PMNS scale provides a tool for researchers and practitioners who want to understand and improve people's mobility experiences and promote positive transportation behaviors.

AB  - Background: The social causation hypothesis suggests that health is influenced by various social factors, including childhood living conditions and mobility pathways, and individual life satisfaction is primarily derived from the subjective sense of mobility and social class. Objectives: Adverse changes in social factors and their negative effects on health have been observed in numerous studies. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between life satisfaction and subjective social mobility status in women from Rasht. Methods: Conducted between 2020 and 2021, this cross-sectional correlational study examined 800 married women residing in Rasht who met the inclusion criteria. Participants were selected using a cluster random method from various areas of the city. Data collection tools included demographic characteristics, the Ferrans and Powers Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, and the MacArthur Scale to measure participants' socioeconomic status (SES). Data analysis was performed using SPSS software and parametric statistical tests. Results: The samples generally comprised individuals with intermediate socioeconomic status, and most participants indicated that their current living situation was better than that of their parents. The lowest average life satisfaction score was observed in the low socioeconomic status group, with participants experiencing downward mobility reporting the lowest life satisfaction scores. However, the results showed no significant difference in the satisfaction levels among different social mobility groups of women (P = 0.60). Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of researchers reflecting on and being sensitive to experiences related to social class and mobility. The study confirmed that individuals with downward social mobility tend to have lower life satisfaction. Social factors are strongly associated with health outcomes, emphasizing the need for the modern healthcare system to consider the impact of social factors on individuals' well-being.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to understand the factors that influence a person in using mobile website e-government. In addition, this study also understands the moderating effect of interface design components on human ergonomic (psychomotor, cognitive, affective. So, the results of this study provide a proposed interface design that fits human ergonomics. Samples and research objects were taken from several e-Government websites in Indonesia that were selected based on the form of layout, content, navigation. Data was taken from 48 respondents by distributing questionnaires and direct observation using eye tracker as a detector of eye movement and mindWave as a brain wave detector. This study adopted and developed the TAM model to explain the causes and consequences of the factors found. We divide the research variables into 2 broad categories. The first category of relative advantage, perceived interactivity, perceived mobility we categorize as perceived usefullnes. While the second category includes psychomotor, cognitive, affective variables we categorize as perceived ease of use. We conducted an analysis using SPSS and SmartPLS to validate the research model. In this study, we found five main factors that influence people's desire to use mobile website e-government. These five factors are relative advantages, perceived mobility, psychomotor, affective and attitude. Furthermore, the components of interface design only affect relationships of affective and attitudes.

AB  - Meaningful change criteria help determine if function has improved or declined, but their magnitudes may vary across clinically relevant subgroups. We estimate meaningful decline in four common measures of physical performance in subgroups of older adults based on initial performance, demographics, chronic conditions, and health status. We used baseline (Year 1) and Year 4 data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, a well-functioning cohort at baseline of white and black men and women (age 70–79), to evaluate the magnitude of meaningful decline in performance (6 m gait speed, 400-m walk time (400MWT), Short Physical Performance Battery, and Health ABC Physical Performance Battery (PPB), based on self-reported perceived mobility anchors (climbing 10 steps and walking ¼ mile). Estimates were stratified by initial performance, demographics, health status, chronic conditions, and body mass index, and compared across strata. For all four measures, small and substantial decline estimates were generally consistent among subgroups based on initial performance, demographics, health status, and chronic conditions. The only exception was for 400MWT, where men had greater estimates than women. For PPB, small change was 0.12 points, and substantial change was 0.22 points. Estimates of small and substantial meaningful decline resemble those previously reported for gait speed, 400MWT, and SPPB. Magnitudes of meaningful performance decline appear to be generally consistent across strata of initial performance, demographics, health status, body mass index, and chronic conditions.

AB  - Abstract This research aimed to analyze the existence of positive, negative, direct, and indirect relationships (via job satisfaction and self-efficacy) between perceiving a calling and turnover intention, as well as the moderating role of perceived mobility. We used a quantitative approach and data collection from 230 employees. The analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling. The results show a direct and negative effect between perceiving a calling and turnover intention, and between job satisfaction and turnover intention. We identified a direct and positive effect between perceiving a calling and job satisfaction and between perceiving a calling and self-efficacy. Job satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between perceiving a calling and turnover intention. There is no significant effect between self-efficacy and turnover intention in the analyzed sample. The moderating effect of perceived mobility on the relationship between job satisfaction and self-efficacy with turnover intention was not significant.

AB  - No study has been conducted linking Chinese migrants’ subjective well-being (SWB) with urban inequality. This paper presents the effects of income and inequality on their SWB using a total of 128,000 answers to a survey question about “happiness”. We find evidence for a satiation point above which higher income is no longer associated with greater well-being. Income inequality is detrimental to well-being. Migrants report lower SWB levels where income inequality is higher, even after controlling for personal income, a large set of individual characteristics, and province dummies. We also find striking differences across socio-economic and geographic groups. The positive effect of income is more pronounced for rural and western migrants, and is shown to be significantly correlated with the poor’s SWB but not for the well-being of more affluent respondents. Interestingly, high-income earners are more hurt by income inequality than low-income respondents. Moreover, compared with migrants in other regions, those in less developed Western China are found to be more averse to income inequality. Our results are quite robust to different specifications. We provide novel explanations for these findings by delving into psychological channels, including egalitarian preferences, social comparison concerns, expectations, perceived fairness concerns and perceived social mobility.

AB  - Objective To explore relationships between balance-confidence and: 1) community participation; 2) self-perceived mobility; and 3) performance-based physical function among individuals with a lower-limb amputation using a prosthetic. Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional study. Setting: Outpatient, multidisciplinary amputee clinic. Participants: Patients (n = 45) using a prosthesis, aged ≥ 18 years, with a unilateral transfemoral or transtibial amputation of ≥1 year, were included. Methods: Participants completed the following self-report measures: Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC); Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ); Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI); and two performance-based measures (i.e. Timed Up and Go and 6 Minute Walk Test). Linear regression modeling was used to explore relationships between balance-confidence (i.e. ABC) and self-report (i.e. CIQ and LCI) and performance-based measures (p ≤ 0.0125). Results: After controlling for potential covariates (i.e. age, sex, and body mass index), balance-confidence explained 47.4% of the variance in CIQ (p = 0.000), 53.0% of the variance in LCI (p = 0.000), 20.3% of the variance in Timed Up and Go (p = 0.001), and 18.2% of the variance in 6 Minute Walk Test (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Lower balance-confidence is associated with less community participation, lower self-perceived mobility, and poorer performance among patients with a unilateral lower-limb amputation.

AB  - There is a major lack of randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of prismatic treatments for hemianopia. Evidence for their effectiveness is mostly based on anecdotal case reports and open-label evaluations without a control condition.To evaluate the efficacy of real relative to sham peripheral prism glasses for patients with complete homonymous hemianopia.Double-masked, randomized crossover trial at 13 study sites, including the Peli laboratory at Schepens Eye Research Institute, 11 vision rehabilitation clinics in the United States, and 1 in the United Kingdom. Patients were 18 years or older with complete homonymous hemianopia for at least 3 months and without visual neglect or significant cognitive decline.Patients were allocated by minimization into 2 groups. One group received real (57-prism diopter) oblique and sham (<5-prism diopter) horizontal prisms; the other received real horizontal and sham oblique, in counterbalanced order. Each crossover period was 4 weeks.The primary outcome was the overall difference, across the 2 periods of the crossover, between the proportion of participants who wanted to continue with (said yes to) real prisms and the proportion who said yes to sham prisms. The secondary outcome was the difference in perceived mobility improvement between real and sham prisms.Of 73 patients randomized, 61 completed the crossover. A significantly higher proportion said yes to real than sham prisms (64% vs 36%; odds ratio, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.8-21.0). Participants who continued wear after 6 months reported greater improvement in mobility with real than sham prisms at crossover end (P = .002); participants who discontinued wear reported no difference.Real peripheral prism glasses were more helpful for obstacle avoidance when walking than sham glasses, with no differences between the horizontal and oblique designs. Peripheral prism glasses provide a simple and inexpensive mobility rehabilitation intervention for hemianopia.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00494676.

AB  - Travel demand models focus on explaining how much individuals actually travel but offer no insight into how much individuals think they travel. The authors propose that the latter is an important determinant of traveler behavior, and that actual mobility is refracted through a variety of filters that magnify or diminish those subjective evaluations of travel amounts. Linear regression models of subjective mobility measures provided by 1,358 San Francisco Bay Area commuters were estimated earlier; the focus of this article is on identifying the potential cognitive and affective mechanisms that influence subjective mobility upward or downward, after controlling for objective mobility. The authors find three major types of mechanisms: awareness-heightening, affective, and comparison-inducing. Recurring patterns of effects in these three categories are analyzed in the light of psychological and marketing research concepts including the availability heuristic, social comparison, relative deprivation, autobiographical memory, and motivation theory.

AB  - Abstract The process of globalization has an important impact on national tax policies. Most of the literature does not focus directly on the political decision-making process and assumes that the desired tax policy is responding to objective underlying tradeoffs. Based on an original survey of members of the German national parliament (Bundestag) in 2006/07, we document a strong ideological bias among policy-makers with respect to the perceived mobility of international tax bases (real capital and paper profits). Ideology also influences, directly and indirectly, the perceived national autonomy in tax setting and preferences for a European Union minimum tax for companies. There seems little consensus as to what the efficiency costs of capital taxation in open economies are, even though our survey falls in a period of extensive debate about, and actual adoption of, a company tax reform bill in Germany.

AB  - Mobile-devices are able to support a wide range of outdoor assessment activities. While there is a significant amount of research that investigates the acceptance of computer-based assessment from one side and the acceptance of mobile learning from the other, relatively few studies focus explicitly on the factors that influence the acceptance of Mobile-based Assessment. The current study implements a mobile-based outdoor educational activity in the city’s Botanic Gardens during an environmental education project. 50 secondary school students participated in a mobile-assisted assessment procedure using Quick Response (QR) - coding technology through their mobile devices. The study examines the impact of Perceived Mobility, Authentic Context and Interest/Enjoyment on students’ Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use and Behavioral Intention to Use Mobile-based Assessment. Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used for the data analysis. Results show that Perceived Mobility, Authentic Context and Interest/Enjoyment, Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use are all significant determinants of Behavioral Intention to Use mobile-based assessment. Furthermore, the study examines the impact of using mobile devices during the learning activity on students’ learning motivation. Implications for designing and implementing mobile-based assessment procedures are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Hip fracture is the most frequent non-intentional injury of older persons leading to hospital admission in North America and Europe. Hip fracture rehabilitation follows the overall goal to get older persons back on their feet and mobile again, up to the point of functional and mobility-related independence in everyday life. This primary outcome, however, is measured in various forms using different methods and assessments. Oftentimes, a singular view is taken, mainly based on repeated physical and locomotor capacity measures without knowledge of the actual mobility behaviour of patients after hospital care and in real life. Cross-sectional data has shown that the relationship between perceived mobility, locomotor capacity, and real-world mobility is not straightforward, however, it remains unclear how all three aspects evolve over time. For a better understanding of this relationship in hip fracture patients, this talk will address respective data of n=566 participants of the hip fracture cohort in the Mobilise-D project. All three aspects of mobility were assessed at baseline and after 12 months. Based on the results, it will be made clear which aspects should be prioritized in both research and clinical practice to obtain a comprehensive picture and clinically useful understanding of mobility of older hip fracture patients.

AB  - This study investigates the divergence between subjective and objective social status in contemporary China, using the unique data assembled from 10 waves of nationally representative surveys from 2003 to 2012. We construct the measure of status discordance by subtracting objective status generated by latent class analysis from self-rated social position. We find that more than half of urban residents in China underestimated their genuine social positions, while more than half of rural residents overestimated it. Regression analyses demonstrate that (1) family income, education, and occupational prestige are negatively correlated with status discordance; (2) the perceived upward social mobility is positively correlated with status discordance; and (3) the effects of objective indicators and perceived mobility differ between urban and rural residents.

AB  - Abstract Functional recovery for people with lower limb amputations is quantified using objective or subjective measures of performance. In this brief report, the prospective relationship between objective and subjective mobility after rehabilitation was evaluated in people with lower limb amputations. Adults undergoing inpatient prosthetic rehabilitation for a first unilateral transtibial or transfemoral level lower limb amputation were recruited. Assessment times: discharge and 4-mo follow-up. Gait velocity and the L Test under single- and dual-task conditions measured objective mobility. The Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (section 4 and question 5b) measured subjective mobility. Paired t tests and Pearson correlation analysis evaluated change over time and the association between mobility types, respectively. Twenty-one people with lower limb amputations (61.6 ± 8.2 yrs) participated. Gait velocity significantly improved (single- and dual-task: P &lt; 0.001). L Test significantly improved for single-task ( P = 0.002) but not dual-task conditions. No statistically significant Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire changes were observed. One subjective mobility question (sidewalk walking) correlated with objective mobility at follow-up (L Test single- and dual-task: r = −0.77; P &lt; 0.001). Objective mobility improved after discharge; however, subjective reporting had no change. Lack of association may represent a mismatch between quantitative outcomes and subjective self-assessment. Both subjective and objective measures of mobility should be collected to provide a holistic picture of clinical and patient-relevant outcomes in people with lower limb amputations.

AB  - Recent works in the field of Social Psychology have shown the importance of studying subjective social mobility from different perspectives. In the literature about subjective societal mobility, most of the research is focused on the mobility-immobility framing. However, several authors suggested studying social mobility beliefs effects differentiating according to mobility’s trajectory, that is, upward (i.e., improving status over time) and downward (i.e., getting worse in status over time). The present research was motivated by the lack of measures that discriminate between beliefs in upward and downward societal mobility. Across two studies using different samples of the Spanish adult population, we examined both dimensions of social mobility beliefs and tested their predictive validity on other related constructs. In Study 1 (N = 164), with an EFA, we corroborated the independence between the two types of mobility. The internal structure was confirmed by a CFA in Study 2 (N = 400). Furthermore, it was shown that upward and downward mobility beliefs are differently related to other related constructs. The results from Studies 1–2 showed good convergent validity. In all correlations with the different constructs (attitudes towards inequality, meritocratic beliefs, justification of the economic system, and status anxiety) we found opposite direction effects for both types of societal mobility (upward and downward). The development of this new instrument can help to deepen our understanding of the psychosocial consequences of subjective social mobility, as well as to differentiate two processes that may have different consequences.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate meaningful improvements in gait speed observed during recovery from hip fracture and to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of gait speed changes in detecting change in self‐reported mobility. DESIGN: Secondary longitudinal data analysis from two randomized controlled trials SETTING: Twelve hospitals in the Baltimore, Maryland, area. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventeen women admitted with hip fracture. MEASUREMENTS: Usual gait speed and self‐reported mobility (ability to walk 1 block and climb 1 flight of stairs) measured 2 and 12 months after fracture. RESULTS: Effect size–based estimates of meaningful differences were 0.03 for small differences and 0.09 for substantial differences. Depending on the anchor (stairs vs walking) and method (mean difference vs regression), anchor‐based estimates ranged from 0.10 to 0.17 m/s for small meaningful improvements and 0.17 to 0.26 m/s for substantial meaningful improvement. Optimal gait speed cutpoints yielded low sensitivity (0.39–0.62) and specificity (0.57–0.76) for improvements in self‐reported mobility. CONCLUSION: Results from this sample of women recovering from hip fracture provide only limited support for the 0.10‐m/s cut point for substantial meaningful change previously identified in community‐dwelling older adults experiencing declines in walking abilities. Anchor‐based estimates and cut points derived from receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggest that greater improvements in gait speed may be required for substantial perceived mobility improvement in female hip fracture patients. Furthermore, gait speed change performed poorly in discriminating change in self‐reported mobility. Estimates of meaningful change in gait speed may differ based on the direction of change (improvement vs decline) or between patient populations.

AB  - Abstract Mobility or physical movement contributes to health and wellbeing in later life. Most studies have focused on the contribution of outdoor mobility to active ageing, but physical and cognitive impairments restrict the mobility of many older adults. This article aims to explore the gaps in the current literature on mobility in later life, and identify required innovations in the field through laying out key areas for future research. It discusses two, largely separate, areas of research, namely on mobility patterns and mobility experiences. The first focuses on quantitative and spatial research on outdoor mobility patterns in terms of routes, timing and transport modes. The second mainly concerns qualitative research on how older adults perceive mobility in their everyday lives. This article identifies three areas for future research on mobility in later life: (a) beyond outdoor movement; (b) diversity in mobility; and (c) the role of time in mobility. To conclude, addressing these areas jointly will contribute to further unpacking the concept of mobility as meaningful practice and to integrating quantitative and qualitative methods when studying mobility in later life. This will result in policy inputs on the mobility and wellbeing of our ageing population.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction/Purpose Little is known about the comparative effectiveness of exercise programs, especially when delivered at a high intensity, in mobility-limited older adults. We compared the effects of 25 sessions of high-intensity agility exergaming (EXE) and stationary cycling (CYC) at the same cardiovascular load on measured and perceived mobility limitations, balance, and health-related quality of life in mobility-limited older adults. Methods Randomized to EXE ( n = 28) and CYC ( n = 27), mobility-impaired older adults (age 70 yr) exercised five times per week for 5 wk at 80% of age-predicted maximal heart rate. Waitlisted controls did not exercise ( n = 28). Results Groups did not differ at baseline in any outcomes ( P &gt; 0.05). The primary outcomes (The Short Form-36-Health Survey: EXE, 6.9%; effect size, 2.2; CYC, 5.5%, 1.94; Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index: EXE, −27.2%, −3.83; CYC, −17.2, −2.90) improved similarly ( P &gt; 0.05). Secondary outcomes, including body mass (−3.7%), depression (−18%), and walking capacity (13.5%) also improved ( P &lt; 0.05) similarly after the two interventions. Activities of daily living, Berg Balance Score, BestTest scores, and Dynamic Gait Index improved more ( P &lt; 0.05) after EXE than CYC. Center of pressure of standing sway path improved in one of six tests only after EXE ( P &lt; 0.05). Postexercise cardiovascular response improved in EXE ( P = 0.019). CON did not change in any outcomes ( P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions When matched for cardiovascular and perceived effort, two diverse high-intensity exercise programs improved health-related quality of life, perceived mobility limitation, and walking capacity similarly and balance outcomes more in mobility-limited older adults, expanding these older adults’ evidence-based exercise options to reduce mobility limitations.

AB  - Traditional taxi services have now been transformed into e-hailing applications (EHA) such as Uber, Careem, Hailo, and Grab Car globally due to the proliferation of smartphone technology. On the one hand, these applications provide transport facilities. On the other hand, users are facing multiple issues in the adoption of EHAs. Despite problems, EHAs are still widely adopted globally. However, a sparse amount of research has been conducted related to EHAs, particular in regards to exploring the significant factors of intention behind using EHAs Therefore, there is a need to identify influencing factors that have a great impact on the adoption and acceptance of these applications. Hence, this research aims to present an empirical study on the factors influencing customers' intentions towards EHAs. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was extended with four external factors: perceived mobility value, effort expectancy, perceived locational accuracy, and perceived price. A questionnaire was developed for the measurement of these factors. A survey was conducted with 211 users of EHAs to collect data. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the collected data. The results of this study exposed that perceived usefulness, perceived price, and perceived ease of use affect behavior intention to use EHAs. Furthermore, perceived ease of use was impacted by effort expectancy, perceived locational accuracy, and perceived mobility. The findings of the study provide a foundation to develop new guidelines for such applications that will be beneficial for developers and designers of these applications.

AB  - In recent decades, China’s rapid economic growth has substantially improved average living standards; however, this has not been accompanied by greater happiness among the Chinese population. This phenomenon is known as the Easterlin Paradox (i.e., there is no link between a society’s economic development and its average level of happiness) in Western countries. This study examined the effects of subjective social class on subjective well-being and mental health in China. Consequently, we found that individuals in a relatively low social class had lower levels of subjective well-being and mental health; self-class discrepancy partially explains the relationship between subjective social class and subjective well-being and fully explains the relationship between subjective social class and mental health; and subjective social mobility moderates the path from self-class discrepancy to subjective well-being and mental health. These findings suggest that enhancing social mobility is an important method for reducing class differences in subjective well-being and mental health. These results have important implications, indicating that enhancing social mobility is an important method for reducing class differences in subjective well-being and mental health in China.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study investigates the factors that influence university students’ intentions to adopt mobile learning for their learning activities. A theoretical model is developed based on prior research incorporating constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and specific mobile learning constructs, as well as the moderating effects of gender and experience. Background: Mobile Learning, the use of smartphones and other mobile devices in accessing education materials, has become increasingly popular in the last decade. Despite the widespread use of smartphones by students, not many universities have adopted mobile learning in their teaching and learning activities. Methodology: A paper-based questionnaire was used to collect data. A final sample of 696 student responses from five urban universities in Indonesia was used. All of the constructs in the model are measured using existing scales. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze and develop the theoretical model using Amos software. Contribution: This research contributes to the theoretical understanding of mobile learning adoption as well as practice and provides guidance for university managers to successfully implement mobile learning in their universities. In particular, the study explores moderating effects due to gender and mobile learning experience and presents more complete findings based on total effects instead of only considering direct effects. Findings: Perceived Enjoyment and Perceived Usefulness are the two most influencing factors in the adoption of mobile learning. Gender moderates the direct effect of learning autonomy on behavioral intention. New findings include significant correlations and causal effects involving learning autonomy, perceived enjoyment, facilitating condition, perceived mobility, social influence, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Recommendations for Practitioners: University managers should ensure that the students can enjoy mobile learning and also find it useful for their learning activities. Furthermore, the University has to facilitate and support the mobile learning system and infrastructure, and they also need to create a university learning environment where professors, senior students, and friends all encourage the adoption of mobile learning. Recommendation for Researchers: Research on mobile learning adoption should consider the moderator effects on the factors of behavioral intention to adopt mobile learning. Different groupings within these moderators should also be examined. Future Research: Additional studies may address and compare findings with respondents from rural Indonesian universities where the infrastructure and facilities are inferior to those in urban universities as well as participants from other cultural contexts.

AB  - Background In the field of pain, virtual reality (VR) technology has been increasingly common in the context of procedural pain management. As an interactive technology tool, VR has the potential to be extended beyond acute pain management to chronic pain rehabilitation with a focus on increasing engagement with painful or avoided movements. Objective We outline the development and initial implementation of a VR program in pain rehabilitation intervention to enhance function in youth with chronic pain. Methods We present the development, acceptability, feasibility, and utility of an innovative VR program (Fruity Feet) for pediatric pain rehabilitation to facilitate increased upper and lower extremity engagement. The development team was an interdisciplinary group of pediatric experts, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, pain psychologists, anesthesiologists, pain researchers, and a VR software developer. We used a 4-phase iterative development process that engaged clinicians, parents, and patients via interviews and standardized questionnaires. Results This study included 17 pediatric patients (13 female, 4 male) enrolled in an intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) program, with mean age of 13.24 (range 7-17) years, completing a total of 63 VR sessions. Overall reports of presence were high (mean 28.98; max 40; SD 4.02), suggestive of a high level of immersion. Among those with multisession data (n=8), reports of pain (P&lt;.001), fear (P=.003), avoidance (P=.004), and functional limitations (P=.01) significantly decreased. Qualitative analysis revealed (1) a positive experience with VR (eg, enjoyed VR, would like to utilize the VR program again, felt VR was a helpful tool); (2) feeling distracted from pain while engaged in VR; (3) greater perceived mobility; and (4) fewer clinician-observed pain behaviors during VR. Movement data support the targeted impact of the Fruity Feet compared to other available VR programs. Conclusions The iterative development process yielded a highly engaging and feasible VR program based on qualitative feedback, questionnaires, and movement data. We discuss next steps for the refinement, implementation, and assessment of impact of VR on chronic pain rehabilitation. VR holds great promise as a tool to facilitate therapeutic gains in chronic pain rehabilitation in a manner that is highly reinforcing and fun.

AB  - This study collected data from 2987 people living with HIV in China and employed structural equation modeling to examine the relationships among social support, depression, and quality of life (QOL). Depression was the strongest predictor of the psychological, energy, and mobility aspects of QOL with β = −.70 (p < .001), β = −.47 (p < .001), and β = −.44 (p < .001), respectively. Emotional social support was a significant predictor of depression (β = −.12, p < .001), mobility (β = .20, p < .001), energy (β = .15, p < .001), and psychological aspect (β = .06, p < .05). Informational social support was a significant predictor of mobility (β = −.08, p < .01), energy (β = −.06, p < .05), and psychological aspect (β = −.07, p < .001). Functional social support was only negatively associated with mobility (β = −.16, p < .01). Therefore, depression had a negative effect on physical (perceived mobility and energy) and psychological (positive/negative feelings, thinking, learning, memory, and concentration) aspects of QOL. Emotional social support had both direct and indirect effects (through its buffering effect on depression) on better QOL. However, the associations between informational social support and the three aspects of QOL were negative; and informational social support did not have a buffering effect on depression. Functional social support was negatively associated with mobility, which means provision of functional support to PLHIV may not necessarily be associated with better QOL. The findings confirm that HIV/AIDS care in China should consider the conceptual differences between emotional, informational, and functional support.

AB  - Abstract Recent studies suggest that South Africa has experienced increased income polarization and is dealing with a struggling middle class. However, with some studies reporting a strong middling tendency, there seems to be a large discrepancy between how people perceive their social position and their actual economic status. Surprisingly, even with the most unequal society label, South Africa has received little attention on the dynamics behind how people perceive their social status. This study uses an ordered probit regression to analyze the determinants of individuals’ subjective social status in South Africa. Results show that objective factors, education, and occupation status positively influence subjective social status. However, subjective social mobility and class imagery are as crucial, confirming the multidimensionality behind subjective social status. Given the high-income polarization and racial inequality in South Africa, the study also showed that factors driving subjective social status are heterogeneous for different race and income groups. The results confirm this and find that discrepant objective and subjective factors influence different populations’ and income groups’ subjective social status.

AB  - The systematic investigation of party-projected images is a relatively recent development in political science. Past studies into this subject have largely dealt with the perceptions of political parties held by various groups, and the perceived mobility of the parties over time with regard to selected dimensions. For the determination of party images held by individuals, most previous works in the field have made use of the semantic differential technique pioneered by Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum. This approach consists of respondents being asked to rank political parties along a number of seven-point scales, each demarcated by a pair of antonyms such as “good-bad” or “slow-fast.” Tests confirming the reliability, validity and comparability of the measure have also been conducted by Osgood et al. , as found in The Measurement of Meaning.

AB  - Abstract Background In Nigeria, hypertensive disorders have become the leading cause of facility-based maternal mortality. Many factors influence pregnant women’s health-seeking behaviors and perceptions around the importance of antenatal care. This qualitative study describes the care-seeking pathways of Nigerian women who suffer from pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. It identifies the influences – barriers and enablers – that affect their decision making, and proposes solutions articulated by women themselves to overcome the obstacles they face. Informing this study is the health belief model, a cognitive value-expectancy theory that provides a framework for exploring perceptions and understanding women’s narratives around pre-eclampsia and eclampsia-related care seeking. Methods This study adopted a qualitative design that enables fully capturing the narratives of women who experienced pre-eclampsia and eclampsia during their pregnancy. In-depth interviews were conducted with 42 women aged 17–48 years over five months in 2015 from Bauchi, Cross River, Ebonyi, Katsina, Kogi, Ondo and Sokoto states to ensure representation from each geo-political zone in Nigeria. These qualitative data were analyzed through coding and memo-writing, using NVivo 11 software. Results We found that many of the beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and behaviors of women are consistent across the country, with some variation between the north and south. In Nigeria, women’s perceived susceptibility and threat of health complications during pregnancy and childbirth, including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, influence care-seeking behaviors. Moderating influences include acquisition of knowledge of causes and signs of pre-eclampsia, the quality of patient-provider antenatal care interactions, and supportive discussions and care seeking-enabling decisions with families and communities. These cues to action mitigate perceived mobility, financial, mistrust, and contextual barriers to seeking timely care and promote the benefits of maternal and newborn survival and greater confidence in and access to the health system. Conclusions The health belief model reveals intersectional effects of childbearing norms, socio-cultural beliefs and trust in the health system and elucidates opportunities to intervene and improve access to quality and respectful care throughout a woman’s pregnancy and childbirth. Across Nigerian settings, it is critical to enhance context-adapted community awareness programs and interventions to promote birth preparedness and social support.

AB  - This work develops a theoretical model to examine the trust building process in an Internet of Things (IoT) based wearable platform. Specifically, various antecedents of trust are considered and its mediating role in the continuance usage intention of the wearables is studied. We also consider the moderating effect of personal innovativeness. An empirical survey is conducted, and 688 usable responses are obtained from the millennial generation users. The data is analyzed using the partial least squares method. Results show that privacy and security concerns are the two biggest hinderances to the trust building process. The users perceive mobility, and usability to be relative advantages, both of which play a positive role in enhancing the trust levels. The effect of personal innovativeness is also observed to be significant. Interestingly, the effect of social influence on the trust level is not supported, which means that boosting a positive image within the social community will not help in the diffusion and continuance usage of the wearables. Based upon the results suitable theoretical and practical implications are discussed, with stress being given to formulate specific strategies targeted towards the highly innovative users, who can improve the overall trust scenario and ensure a continued usage of the wearables.

In this study, a meta-analysis method was used to comprehensively analyze a total of 74,964 independent samples of 31 relevant empirical research documents at home and abroad. The results show that the main influencing factors of mobile reading are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived mobility, perceived entertainment, social influence, cognitive adjustment, perceived value, usage attitude, interface design, etc. Cognitive adjustment and usage attitude have the greatest impact on intention to use, followed by perceived usefulness, perceived mobility, subjective norms, perceived ease of use; perceived ease of use has a significant positive impact on perceived usefulness; interface design has a significant positive effect on perceived ease of use; behavioral intention has a significant positive effect on actual behavior; and perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a significant positive effect on usage attitude.

AB  - In recent years, several countries have undertaken political initiatives aimed at reducing immigration. At present, we lack a clear understanding of how self-initiated expatriates (SIEs) living in these countries interpret and respond to such initiatives. The United Kingdom's 2016 "Brexit" referendum decision to leave the European Union presents an example of one such initiative potentially impacting the mobility, U.K. identification, and future aspirations of European SIEs living in the United Kingdom. We draw on 41 in-depth interviews with SIEs from 18 European countries who had voluntarily chosen to relocate to the United Kingdom, and analyze how they interpreted the Brexit vote, as well as its impact on their identities and migration plans. We identify four types of SIEs based on their perceived mobility and identification with the United Kingdom prior to the Brexit referendum, each of which was associated with a distinct reaction pattern related to the outcome of the referendum. Our findings have implications for the study of SIEs, as well as for talent managers charged with their retention. We suggest directions for future research in SIE management.

AB  - Background and aims Individual MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease are associated with gait impairment. The impact of total cerebral small vessel disease-related brain damage, expressed by a cerebral small vessel disease MRI burden score, on mobility after stroke, has not been considered, although this score gives a better representation of the overall effect of cerebral small vessel disease on the brain. We determined if the total cerebral small vessel disease burden is associated with gait impairment three years after minor stroke. Methods In total, 200 patients with minor lacunar or non-lacunar stroke (NIHSS ≤ 7) underwent a brain MRI at presentation. Presence of lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microbleeds, and perivascular spaces were summed in a total cerebral small vessel disease MRI burden score (range 0–4). Gait disturbances, measured by timed-up-and-go test and self-reported stroke impact scale mobility domain were assessed three years after stroke. We tested associations adjusted for key variables by linear regression analysis. Results Total cerebral small vessel disease burden was not associated with gait impairment after minor stroke in all patients, nor in lacunar stroke patients ( n = 87). In non-lacunar stroke patients ( n = 113), total cerebral small vessel disease burden was associated with lower stroke impact scale mobility domain scores, independent of age, vascular risk factors, and stroke severity (unstandardized B −4.61; 95% CI −8.42; −0.79, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Patients with non-lacunar stroke and a higher total cerebral small vessel disease burden have more subjective mobility impairment three years after stroke. The total cerebral small vessel disease MRI burden score is a possible marker to identify patients at risk for subjective gait impairment. These findings should be confirmed in larger studies.

AB  - Following the implementation of temporary pop-up bike lanes in Berlin, traffic counts by the city administration show an increased number of cyclists. This present paper aims to understand reasons behind this observation. To this end, we focus on the role of mobility-related descriptive social norms as mediators of this effect. Results from one correlational and two experimental online studies are reported. The correlational study confirms the expected association of mobility-related descriptive social norms and self-reported mobility behavior. Moreover, it demonstrates that, as expected, mobility-related descriptive social norms reliably reflect differences in cities’ objective transport structure and mediate the impact of these infrastructural differences on mobility behavior. Results from two online experiments provide additional causal evidence that participants use the visual cues provided by manipulated photos to form their perceived mobility-related descriptive social norms. Furthermore, the second online experiment provides evidence that the combination of infrastructural cues and observable mobility behavior has the strongest impact on perceived mobility-related descriptive social norms.

AB  - The article focuses on individual income mobility among Russians in the years 2009–2017, as measured objectively and subjectively. As in previous periods of post-Soviet development, income mobility in Russia remains high. In comparison to member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), income mobility in Russia is higher, while the level of persistent well-being is lower. Subjective assessments of one’s income situation are even more volatile than objective positions on an income scale, with persistent subjective well-being almost non-existent. Furthermore, subjective mobility does not correlate closely with its objective counterpart. Persistent well-being in terms of objective and subjective income is determined by a combination of class and non-class factors, including, above all, labor market position, dependency burden, and health status.

AB  - Mobility is often referred to as a 'sixth vital sign' because of its ability to predict critical health outcomes in later adulthood. In the World Health Organization (WHO) World Report on Aging and Health, mobility is described as movement in all its forms whether powered by the body or a vehicle. As such, mobility encompasses basic physical actions such as getting up from a chair and walking, as well as activities such as exercising, driving and using public transportation. A plethora of measurement tools have been developed to assess various aspects of mobility; however, there is wide variability in the mobility constructs being measured which limits standardisation and meaningful comparison across studies. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for measuring mobility that considers three distinct facets of mobility: perceived mobility ability ('what can you do'), actual mobility ability ('what you actually do') and locomotor capacity for mobility ('what could you do'). These three facets of mobility are rooted in the three components of healthy aging endorsed by the WHO: functional ability, intrinsic capacity and environments. By proposing a unified framework for measuring mobility based on theory and empirical evidence, we can advance the science of monitoring and managing mobility to ensure functional ability in older age.

AB  - Mobile service innovation has become a critical issue in the financial sectors. Currently, many banks in Taiwan have developed various mobile services for their customers. However, mobile services in financial sectors are different from Internet services because of the mobility. First, mobile services enable mobile extensions of existing electronic services and new services that are valuable to users on the move. Second, most people have their own, personal mobile devices in the hands, but they may not have the computers with them anytime. Although consumers’ technology acceptance has been examined in the context of e-commerce, mobile financial services are gained scant attention. Thus, this study aims to explore the factors influencing the use of mobile financial services (MFS). We conducted a qualitative research in depth, and investigated a renowned bank in Taiwan which developed various MFS for customers. The findings reveal that perceived mobility and personal habit are two important antecedents influencing the use of MFS. Mobility positively affects perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness, which in turn influence the use of MFS. Furthermore, personal habit positively affects the use of MFS.

AB  - Purpose: This study tested the hypothesis that greater perceived cognitive concerns are associated with worse mobility in a cohort of prosthesis users with lower limb loss (LLL).Method: We performed a secondary analysis of cross-sectional self-report data from a volunteer sample of people with LLL due to dysvascular and non-dysvacular causes. Perceived cognitive difficulties were assessed using the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Applied Cognition – General Concerns (Neuro-QoL ACGC). Mobility was measured with the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) and the Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility (PLUS-M). Simple linear regressions examined univariate relationships between cognitive concerns and mobility. Multiple linear regression analyses included demographic and amputation-related variables that could influence this relationship.Results: Analysis of data from 1291 people with LLL demonstrated that greater cognitive concerns, measured by the Neuro-QoL ACGC, were associated with poorer perceived mobility, measured by both ABC and PLUS-M instruments. This relationship remained statistically significant after adjusting for demographic and amputation-related factors.Conclusions: These results suggest that greater cognitive concerns are associated with worse mobility among a broad range of people with LLL. An improved understanding of this relationship is critical for optimizing rehabilitation outcomes for this population.Implications for rehabilitationRehabilitation for people with lower limb loss (LLL) typically focuses on physical impairments and mobility limitations, but cognition is increasingly recognized to have an impact on functional outcomes.Greater perceived cognitive concerns are associated with poorer mobility among a broad range of people with LLL, even when adjusting for demographic and amputation-related factors.Cognitive status can impact relevant rehabilitative outcomes, including mobility, and should be considered when planning prosthetic and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Purpose Cognitive deficits and gait and balance problems are progressive in people with Alzheimer's dementia. Yet, mobility aids are associated with an increased falls risk in people with dementia. Our objectives were to identify the perceptions of people living with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's dementia, and their caregivers, on the use of mobility aids.Methods A qualitative study using semi-structured, face-to-face interviews was conducted. Community-dwelling older adults with dementia attending a day hospital program were recruited. Thematic analysis was conducted and the text was coded into broad themes aligned with the research questions. The coded text was examined for patterns and similarities, and grouped to form inductive themes.Results Twenty-four people (12 living with dementia and their 12 caregivers) participated. Five themes were identified: (1) acknowledgement of need; (2) protecting a sense of self; (3) caregiver oversight and relief of burden; (4) healthcare professional involvement; (5) environment and design of aids.Conclusions The findings suggest that people with Alzheimer's dementia and their caregivers regard mobility aid use as increasing independence. There is a role for healthcare professionals to be involved in the prescription, provision and training for use of mobility aids among people living with dementia to ensure uptake and safety.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONMobility aid use is regarded as increasing independence by people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.Falls risk associated with mobility aid use was not well known and caregivers perceived mobility aids as a means to reduce falls.Most people do not see a healthcare professional when they acquire a mobility aid and there is a role for healthcare professionals to be involved in the prescription, provision and training of people living with dementia in the use of mobility aids in order to increase the uptake of aids and their safe use.

AB  - Introduction: Movement related impairments and limitations in walking are common long-term after stroke. This multi-arm randomized controlled trial explored the impact of training with an electromechanically assisted gait training (EAGT) system, i.e., the Hybrid Assistive Limb ® (HAL), when integrated with conventional rehabilitation focused on gait and mobility. Material and Methods: Participants, aged 18–70 years with lower extremity paresis but able to walk with manual support or supervision 1–10 years after stroke, were randomized to (A) HAL-training on a treadmill, combined with conventional rehabilitation interventions (HAL-group), or (B) conventional rehabilitation interventions only (Conventional group), 3 days/week for 6 weeks, or (C) no intervention (Control group). Participants in the Control group were interviewed weekly regarding their scheduled training. Primary outcome was endurance in walking quantified by the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT). A rater blinded to treatment allocation performed assessments pre- and post-intervention and at follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Baseline assessment included the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Modified Ranking Scale (MRS). Secondary outcomes included the Fugl Meyer Assessment- Lower Extremity, 10 Meter Walk Test, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Barthel Index (BI) and perceived mobility with the Stroke Impact Scale. Results: A total of 48 participants completed the intervention period. The HAL-group walked twice as far as the Conventional group during the intervention. Post-intervention, both groups exhibited improved 6 MWT results, while the Control group had declined. A significant improvement was only found in the Conventional group and when compared to the Control group (Tukey HSD p = 0.022), and not between the HAL group and Conventional group (Tukey HSD p = 0.258) or the HAL- group and the Control group (Tukey HSD p = 0.447). There was also a significant decline in the Conventional group from post-intervention to 6 months follow up ( p = 0.043). The best fitting model to predict outcome included initial balance (BBS), followed by stroke severity (NIHSS), and dependence in activity and participation (BI and MRS). Conclusion: Intensive conventional gait training induced significant improvements long-term after stroke while integrating treadmill based EAGT had no additional value in this study sample. The results may support cost effective evidence-based interventions for gait training long-term after stroke and further development of EAGT.

AB  - Abstract Background Disengagement from outdoor recreation may diminish the positive benefits on health and well-being in old age. The purpose of this study is to present a contextual, theoretical, and empirical rationale for an intervention, aiming to promote continued engagement in outdoor recreation for older adults in a Swedish context. Methods The paper includes a contextualization of outdoor recreation in Sweden, a presentation of evidence on health benefits related to engagement in outdoor recreation, together with theoretical frameworks that may guide future intervention designs. To add empirical knowledge, a mixed methods approach was applied, including an empirical data collection based on a quantitative survey ( n = 266) and individual semi-structured interviews with older adults ( n = 12). Survey data were presented with descriptive statistics. Associations between disengagement from previously performed activities and age and gender was analyzed with Chi 2 tests. Transcripts and handwritten notes from the interviews were analyzed qualitatively to identify key themes, as well as patterns and disparities among respondents. Results Outdoor recreation was rated as important/very important by 90% of respondents of the survey. The interviews highlighted that engagement in outdoor recreation aided respondents to keep fit but had also relevance in terms of identity, experiences, and daily routines. Outdoor recreation close to the place of residence was most common and walking was the most frequently reported activity. While 80% considered their health to be good/very good, disability and long-term diseases were common and during the previous year, more than half of all respondents had disengaged from activities previously performed. Reasons for disengagement were mainly related to health decline or that activities were too demanding but also due to social loss. The interviews indicated that continued engagement was important but challenging, and that disengagement could be considered as a loss or accepted due to changing circumstances. Conclusions In the design of an intervention aiming to promote engagement in outdoor recreation for older adults, the following features are proposed to be considered: person-centeredness, promoting functioning, addressing self-ageism, providing environmental support, promoting subjective mobility needs and adaptation to find new ways to engage in outdoor recreation.

AB  - The article presents preliminary results of the collective project "Intergenerational mobility from 20th to 21st century: four generations of Russian history". It aims to enrich the project's methodological assumptions by looking for the most effective and promising ways to analyze the collected data. The article sets out explore the ways to fuse different data into a single complex and determines strategies of further analysis. The strategy is based on the socio-biographical approach to social mobility. The article presents its various aspects — intergenerational and intragenerational, a concept of subjective social mobility and variations in merging various types of data — qualitative, quantitative, primary and secondary. The article gets into methodological reflexion faced with a necessity to pass from an empirical to an analytical stage. It delineates possible strategies to analyze variegated data and reveals the logical foundations and complexities of such a transition.

AB  - A concerning post-secondary education gap exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals in Canada.One program designed to help address this issue, the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP), provides eligible First Nations students with post-secondary education funding.Although such programs are beneficial, it is unclear how much Canadians support public funding of Indigenous education and whether psychological research can help explain why some may endorse or oppose it.Thus, using the PSSSP as an example, we examined five possible psychological predictors of public support: personal prejudice towards Indigenous Peoples, perceived social mobility, meritocratic beliefs, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism.Based on previous research, we hypothesized that all would negatively relate to support for the PSSSP.In a sample of non-Indigenous Canadian adults, we found that only higher personal prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism uniquely explained lower support for the program (or conversely, lower prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political liberalism, were related to higher program support).Although correlational, this study provides insight into factors that may influence Canadians' attitudes toward a program aimed at addressing a consequential societal inequality.We discuss the implications of these findings with regards to support for programs and policies targeted at marginalized groups.

KW  - Tax Policy
AB  - The process of globalization has an important impact on national tax policies. Most of the literature on taxation of capital in open economies does not focus directly on the political decision making process and assumes that the desired tax policy is responding to objective underlying tradeoffs. Based on an original survey of members of German national parliament (Bundestag) in 2006/7 we document a strong ideological bias among policy makers with respect to the perceived mobility of international tax bases (mobility of real capital and shifting of paper profits). Ideology via party affiliation influences also directly and indirectly the perceived national autonomy in tax setting and preferences for a EU minimum tax for companies. There seems little consensus as to what the efficiency cost of capital taxation in open economies are, even though our survey falls in period of extensive debate about and actual adoption of a company tax reform bill in Germany.

AB  - Existing evidence which is primarily based on cross-sectional and observational data suggests that perceptions of doing worse or better than parents might be more important for various life outcomes than the conventional measures of mobility based on the objective indicators of socioeconomic position. In 2021, we commissioned a nationally representative survey in Georgia which included a population-wide randomized survey experiment. We confirmed the association between, on the one hand, perceived social mobility and, on the other hand, physical and mental health, satisfaction with life, and the perceived state of affairs in the country. More importantly, the experimental design allowed us to conclude that the perception of being downwardly mobile was causally determined by a short message shared with individuals that equality of opportunity in their country was low. Those who were given information that children’s socioeconomic position was strongly linked to their parents’ socioeconomic position were seven percentage points more likely than individuals in the control group to perceive themselves as being downwardly mobile. We extrapolate these findings to the broader context and argue that the messages about (in)equality of opportunity which individuals receive in their everyday lives might also shape their perceptions of social mobility in other countries.

AB  - Abstract Kiamaiko in Nairobi hosts one of the largest goat markets in East Africa. The goats come from across Kenya and the region, as do many of the people there, illustrating how regional movements of human and animal bodies are part of Nairobi’s becoming, and making Kiamaiko an extremely diverse part of the city. Through a discussion of the working lives of people involved in Kiamaiko’s goat meat industry, this article explores the material flows and blockages, and processes of containment and transformation, that entangle lives and livelihoods in Kiamaiko with those of the city as a whole. These flows and processes are marked by uncertainties and contingencies that can be both full of potentiality for (re)forging regimes of order, social relations, subjectivities, mobility and livelihood aspirations, and entrench inequalities, social hierarchies and exclusions, as well as undermine the safe containment of material forms essential for liveable lives. Since the mid-2000s, city authorities have repeatedly failed to impose planning and public health-related regulations and relocation on Kiamaiko’s goat industry. These efforts and their repeated failure reflect the emergent but productive excessivities of the material, corporeal and bodily flows that constitute cities, which both demand and yet often defy formal mechanisms of regulation, containment and order.

AB  - The aim of this study is to identify the factors behind consumers’ adoption of shopping via mobile applications and to develop a new model that explains this situation. The related literature was examined for this purpose. Delphi technique was preferred to determine factors in the study. Data was collected through questionnaires. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted with SPSS. A research model based on an integration of various theoretical fields was developed. As a result of EFA, ten new dimensions emerged in the study. And then, in order to statistically analyze the measurement and structural models, this study used Smart PLS for Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique. After path analysis with Smart PLS, a new conceptual model was developed to explain adoption of shopping via mobile applications by consumers in Turkey. Structures such as Personalization, Word of Mouth Communication and Perceived Mobility used in the model developed within the scope of this research, but rarely used in this field of studies, were verified to be determinants of shopping behavior via mobile applications in Turkey. The model developed within the study is both valid and reliable in terms of its structure and all relations established within the scope of the model are significant.

AB  - A concerning post-secondary education gap exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals in Canada. One program designed to help address this issue, the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP), provides eligible First Nations students with post-secondary education funding. Although such programs are beneficial, it is unclear how much Canadians support public funding of Indigenous education and whether psychological research can help explain why some may endorse or oppose it. Thus, using the PSSSP as an example, we examined five possible psychological predictors of public support: personal prejudice towards Indigenous Peoples, perceived social mobility, meritocratic beliefs, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that all would negatively relate to support for the PSSSP. In a sample of non-Indigenous Canadian adults, we found that only higher personal prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism uniquely explained lower support for the program (or conversely, lower prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political liberalism, were related to higher program support). Although correlational, this study provides insight into factors that may influence Canadians’ attitudes toward a program aimed at addressing a consequential societal inequality. We discuss the implications of these findings with regards to support for programs and policies targeted at marginalized groups.

AB  - Longitudinal data are vital in order to understand intra individual gait changes with the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship between changes in disability with changes in major spatio-temporal parameters of gait in people with MS (PwMS). PwMS (n = 83) completed two gait assessments performed at separate time points (M1, M2). For each individual, the absolute difference between the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, key spatio-temporal parameters of gait, Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I), and the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), were calculated. The mean time difference between M1 and M2 was 2.5 (SD = 1.7) years. At M2, PwMS presented with shorter strides, a wider base of support, increased perceived mobility difficulties and fear of falling compared with M1. According to the odds ratio (OR) analysis, the odds of experiencing an increase in the EDSS score was significantly higher once the MSWS-12 score increased at M2 compared with M1 (OR = 7.930, p = 0.004). This observation was highlighted specifically in people with mild-moderate MS (OR = 12.427, p < 0.001). The increase in the EDSS score was not associated with changes in key spatio-temporal parameters of gait. The present study provides a better understanding of gait and disease progression in PwMS, highlighting the significant role of the MSWS-12.

AB  - Migrants’ self-assessments refer to their perceptions of social mobility and positioning. These assessments are often ambivalent and counterintuitive for observers. To overcome contradictory first impressions, we propose a comprehensive approach to migrants’ self-assessments that goes beyond the opposition between objective and subjective social mobility and links the transnational context, various social spheres, actors’ migratory projects, and their reflexivity. The empirical materials in this article draw on two studies on Chinese migrants in France and confront the trajectories and viewpoints of undocumented migrants and international students. Beyond the differences between their experiences and their legal, economic, and social statuses in France and China, we highlight several common points: First, both groups considered migration a lever to improve their social status. Second, their evaluations link their regions of origin and destination as well as various social spheres. Third, in a transnational context, many factors at different scales influence migrants’ subjective self-assessments of the success or failure of their migration. The migrants’ assessments can vary according to their emphasis on professional, personal, or family trajectories, or on their choice of reference groups. They are shaped by the complexity of translations of status from one country to another and by rapid social transformation in China. Thus, many interviewees estimate that they are simultaneously in situations of social progression and regression.

AB  - This paper examines perceptions of micro justice and macro justice in contemporary China, focusing on comparisons among rural–urban migrants, urban locals and rural villagers. It puts forward three possibilities concerning distributive justice among rural–urban migrants relative to other groups, based on the social position hypothesis, reference group hypothesis, and subjective mobility hypothesis. Data from the 2010 Chinese General Social Survey largely support the reference group hypothesis. Rural–urban migrants are significantly more likely than urban locals to view their income level and society as fair, and the difference in perceived fairness of own income between the two groups varies by income level. Rural villagers and rural–urban migrants hold similar views on micro justice and macro justice. This paper contributes to the existing literature by suggesting that: (1) socio-economic status is not necessarily positively associated with favorable views of the current distributive system; and (2) social comparisons may play a more important role.

AB  - In recent years, the widespread shift toward online learning in higher education has led to a notable increase in the utilization of collaborative mobile-assisted language learning (MALL). However, the efficacy and implementation of MALL in college settings remain subjects of ongoing scholarly debate. To gain deeper insights into the experiences of Chinese college students with collaborative MALL and investigate factors that may influence their intentions for further adoption, this study proposed a comprehensive model that integrates the updated Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and flow theory.The model aimed to assess the relationship between flow and various antecedents, including perceived cost, social influences, perceived mobility, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, which shape students' intentions to adopt collaborative MALL. A survey was conducted among a sample of 831 students from 32 provinces and autonomous regions.The data analysis revealed that while 73% of participants reported having experienced collaborative MALL, overall adoption levels among Chinese college students are still in its initiative stage of adoption. Furthermore, variations were observed in the experiences of students from different majors and level of education. Importantly, the assessment of the proposed Mobile Collaborative Language Learning (MCLL) Model demonstrated the significant role of flow in predicting the adoption of collaborative MALL among Chinese college students.The study concludes with suggestions for future research opportunities based on the research findings, aiming to enhance our understanding and application of collaborative MALL in higher education contexts.

AB  - Many social issues exist for marginalized youth in the New Territories of Hong Kong, despite Hong Kong’s high standard of living. Increasingly, attention is being paid to social mobility of Hong Kong’s younger generations. Youth in the New Territories face academic, economic, social and cultural barriers, in part due to tracking into low-ranked Band 3 schools. In order to better understand these barriers, this study took a phenomenological approach to understanding selected youth’s perceptions and perspectives on these barriers. This qualitative case study, being both exploratory and descriptive, developed thematic findings across interviews, field observations and document analysis in order to understand disadvantaged youth’s personal perceptions and attitudes of youth social mobility. Youth and teacher interview participants also took part, to varying degrees, in the programs provided by Hong Kong-based NGO, Project Share. The study attempts to further our understanding of the lived experiences and perceived social mobility barriers unique to these marginalized youth. Findings illustrate issues that NGOs, practitioners, school officials and policy makers may want to consider when approaching work with disadvantaged youth and attempting to understanding youth issues in Hong Kong from the youth perspective.

AB  - A survey of dairy producers in Pennsylvania was undertaken to ascertain the management of market cows and identify practices currently used to improve the quality of beef from these animals. Ninety dairy producers in Pennsylvania were selected based on recommendations from financial advisers and consultants who suggested that these producers would have the necessary records required to complete the survey. Of these 90 producers surveyed, 69 provided usable responses to the survey (77% response). Average herd size of respondents was 280 ± 226 cows. During on-farm interviews, producers were asked questions regarding how market cows were sold, condition of cows sold, drug residue notifications, vaccination and injection administration, foot trimming frequency, and perceived mobility of market cows. The results of the survey indicated that most producers market cattle through auction markets. The survey also showed that most producers did not use marketing strategies to take advantage of seasonal cow beef price variability. The average number of injections given annually to dairy cows was 19.4 ± 12.4. The percentage of injections given in the neck varied, but very few producers administered all injections in the neck; a majority of injections (65%) were given in other sites. The tail-head or the hip/ rump/flank areas were identified as the most common sites. Producers also reported a 5% annual rate of "downer" cows, the principal cause being metabolic disorders.

AB  - Objective Adopting an external focus of attention has been shown to benefit motor performance and learning. However, the potential of optimizing attentional focus for improving prosthetic motor skills in lower limb prosthesis (LLP) users has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the frequency and direction of attentional focus embedded in the verbal instructions in a clinical prosthetic training setting. Methods Twenty-one adult LLP users (8 female, 13 male; 85% at K3 level; mean age = 50.5) were recruited from prosthetic clinics in the Southern Nevada region. Verbal interactions between LLP users and their prosthetists (mean experience = 10 years, range = 4–21 years) during prosthetic training were recorded. Recordings were analyzed to categorize the direction of attentional focus embedded in the instructional and feedback statements as internal, external, mixed, or unfocused. We also explored whether LLP users’ age, time since amputation, and perceived mobility were associated with the proportion of attentional focus statements they received. Results We recorded a total of 20 training sessions, yielding 904 statements of instruction from 338 minutes of training. Overall, one verbal interaction occurred every 22.1 seconds. Among the statements, 64% were internal, 9% external, 3% mixed, and 25% unfocused. Regression analysis revealed that female, older, and higher functioning LLP users were significantly more likely to receive internally-focused instructions (p = 0.006, 0.035, and 0.024, respectively). Conclusions Our results demonstrated that verbal instructions and feedback are frequently provided to LLP users during prosthetic training. Most verbal interactions are focused internally on the LLP users’ body movements and not externally on the movement effects. Impact statement While more research is needed to explore how motor learning principles may be applied to improve LLP user outcomes, clinicians should consider adopting the best available scientific evidence during treatment. Overreliance on internally-focused instructions as observed in the current study may hinder prosthetic skill learning.

AB  - Utilization of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) in the field of learning continues to grow, include in the higher education learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence the student's intention to use mobile learning with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. The sample was Economic Education students of Semarang State University who have taken courses learning development. Extended-TAM by Huang et al. (2007); & Zhu et al., (2012) have been used to collect the data. Data analysis used path analysis to test hypothesis and analysis data. The result showed that the students have good ability to use their mobile gadget for learning purposes. In the extended-TAM frame, two primer factors (perceived usefulness and perceived ease to use) have positive effect to attitude toward using and behavioral intention to use. Other result showed external factors (perceived mobility value, perceived social interaction value and prior experience) proven have positive effect to perceived usefulness. Perceived enjoyment have significant relationship with perceived to use and attitude toward using.

AB  - To determine intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of functional outcome measures in adults with neurofibromatosis 1 and to ascertain how closely objective and subjective measures align.A total of 49 ambulant adults with neurofibromatosis 1 aged 16 years and over were included in this observational study: median age 31 years (range: 16-66 years), 29 females, 20 males. Participants were video-recorded or photographed performing four functional outcome measures. Four raters from the neurofibromatosis centre multi-disciplinary team independently scored the measures to determine inter-rater reliability. One rater scored the measures a second time on a separate occasion to determine intra-rater reliability. The measures evaluated were the functional reach, timed up and go, 10 m walk and a modified nine-hole peg tests. Participants also completed a disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire.Inter-rater reliability and intra-rater reliability scores (intra-class coefficient) were similar for each outcome measure. Excellent rater agreement (intra-class coefficient, r ⩾ 0.9) was found for the functional reach, timed up and go and the 10 m walk tests. Rater agreement was good for the modified nine-hole peg test: intra-class coefficient r = 0.75 for intra-rater reliability and 0.76 for inter-rater reliability. The timed up and go and the 10 m walk tests correlated highly with perceived mobility challenges in the quality-of-life questionnaire.The functional reach, timed up and go and 10 m walk tests are potentially useful outcome measures for monitoring neurofibromatosis 1 treatment and will be assessed in multi-centre and longitudinal studies.

AB  - The article focuses on individual income mobility amongst Russians in the years 2009–2017. As in previous periods of post-Soviet development, income mobility in Russia remains high. In comparison to OECD member countries, income mobility is higher, while the level of persistent well-being is lower. Subjective individual assessments of income situation are more volatile than objective positions, with persistent subjective well-being almost non-existent. Subjective mobility does not correlate closely with its objective counterpart. Persistent well-being is determined by a combination of class and non-class factors, including labour market position, dependency burden and health status.

AB  - This research mainly aims to explore the factors that influence users' continuous use of mobile libraries. The findings of this study will provide empirical evidence to help improve the service and information quality of mobile libraries. Moreover, suggestions for optimization are provided with the objective of meeting user demands at its maximum. A theoretical model is constructed to reveal the impact of 11 influencing factors on users' continuous use of mobile libraries. Structural equation modeling is adopted to verify the theoretical model and research hypothesis based on the valid data obtained from a questionnaire survey. The study found that personalized services and information availability have positive impacts on the service quality of mobile libraries. Moreover, perceived mobility and information quality have positive impacts on the perceived usability of mobile libraries. Finally, perceived usability, service quality, and platform stability have significantly positive impacts on the willingness of users to continue usage of mobile libraries.

AB  - Abstract Background Young adults with mobility disability report lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than their able-bodied peers. This study aims to examine potential differences between the effects of mobile app versus supervised training and the association of cardiorespiratory fitness change with HRQoL in young adults with mobility disability. Methods This is a secondary analysis of a parallel randomized controlled trial of a mobile app ( n = 55) and a supervised health program ( n = 55) that was provided for 12 weeks to 110 adults (18–45 years) with self-perceived mobility disability. Recruitment took place at rehabilitation centers in Stockholm, Sweden. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated from the results of a submaximal cycle ergometer test and HRQoL was assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire. Follow up was at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1-year and all examinations were performed by blinded investigators. Between group differences of changes in HRQoL at follow up were estimated in intention-to-treat analysis using linear regression models. Crude and adjusted mixed-effects models estimated the associations between cardiorespiratory fitness change and HRQoL. Stratified analysis by intervention group was also performed. Results In total, 40/55 from the mobile app group and 49/55 from the supervised training group were included in the intention to treat analysis. No significant differences were observed between the effects of the two interventions on HRQoL. In both crude and adjusted models, cardiorespiratory fitness change was associated with the general health (adjusted β = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.48, 2.13) and emotional role functioning (adjusted β = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.11, 2.25) domains of SF-36. After stratification, the associations with general health (adjusted β = 1.88, 95% CI: 0.87, 2.90) and emotional role functioning (adjusted β = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.18, 2.57) were present only in the supervised group.

AB  - Background: Four-corner arthrodesis with scaphoid excision (FCA) and proximal row carpal resection (PRC) are frequently performed in wrists with post-traumatic Scaphoid Non- Union Advanced Collapse (SNAC)/Scapho-Lunate Advanced Collapse (SLAC) osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of these two procedures. Methods: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included all patients who had PRC or FCA between January 1st, 2009 and January 1st, 2019 and who were followed up. Follow-up included: mobility (radial deviation, ulnar deviation, flexion, extension), strength (grip test, pinch test), function (QuickDash, patient-rated wrist evaluation [PRWE]), subjective mobility, and global satisfaction scores. Results: Among 25 patients included, 11 had PRC and 14 had FCA with a mean follow-up of 69.5 months [12–132]. Radial deviation was 18° versus 14° (p = 0.7), ulnar deviation was 21° versus 22° (p = 0.15), flexion was 39° versus 30° (p = 0.32), extension was 32.5° versus 29.5° (p = 0.09), grip test compared to the controlateral side was 72% versus 62% (p = 0.53), Quick Dash score was 12.5 versus 17.6 (p = 0.84), PRWE was 18.7 versus 17.6 (p = 0.38), subjective mobility was 7.8 versus 7.5 (p = 0.23), and satisfaction score was 8.7 versus 9 (p = 0.76), respectively, in the FCA group and the PRC group. Re-operation rates were 14% patients in the FCA group and 0% in the PRC group. Conclusion: This study found no significant difference between FCA and PRC on strength, mobility, and function in patients with post-traumatic SLAC or SNAC stage II wrist arthritis. Both FCA and PRC seem to be reliable surgical techniques with good outcomes with more revision in the FCA group.

AB  - Background:Objective motor ratings and subjective motor complaints are both widely used in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the objective basis to the self-perceived mobility quality is still not well elucidated. Purposes: We aimed to figure out the relevancy between the UPDRS motor scores and PDQ39 mobility sub-scores, and further explore whether physician-assessed motor dysfunctions and patients-reported mobility deficits have some shared mechanisms. Methods: 49 patients with PD who completed the PDQ39 scale were retrospectively included. The relevancy between mobility quality and UPDRS scores was assessed, as well as the related presynaptic dopaminergic binding (11C-CFT) and glucose metabolism (18F-FDG) in this dual-tracer PET imaging study. Results: Modest correlation was found between UPDRS motor score and the PDQ39 mobility sub-score (r=0.440, p=0.002). No correlation was found between PDQ39 mobility SI and the dopaminergic lesions in putamen; however, the strict correlation was found with the UPDRS motor scores. In terms of global PD related pattern (PDRP) scores, the two motor scores both correlated strictly. In the further regional metabolism exploration, cerebellum correlated positively with PDQ39 mobility sub-scores, and the frontal and parietal regions mainly correlated negatively with the motor quality scores. Conclusions: UPDRS motor scores and PDQ39 mobility scores were only modestly correlated. The mechanisms involved under mobility quality were beyond dopaminergic deficiency, including motor related cerebellum hyper-metabolism and non-motor related frontal hypo-metabolism. Conclusively, the self-reported mobility experience may have the neurophysiological basis related to both motor and non-motor manifestations in PD.

AB  - Self-report tools are recommended in research and clinical practice to capture individual perceptions regarding health status; however, only modest correlations are found with performance-based results. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) is one well-validated measure of impairment affecting physical activities that has been compared with objective tests. More recently, mobile gait assessment software can provide comprehensive motion tracking output from ecologically valid environments, but how this data relates to subjective scales is unknown. Therefore, the association between the LEFS and walking variables remotely collected by a smartphone was explored.Proprietary algorithms extracted spatiotemporal parameters detected by a standard integrated inertial measurement unit from 132 subjects enrolled in physical therapy for orthopedic or neurological rehabilitation. Users initiated ambulation recordings and completed questionnaires through the OneStep digital platform. Discrete categories were created based on LEFS score cut-offs and Analysis of Variance was applied to estimate the difference in gait metrics across functional groups (Low-Medium-High).The main finding of this cross-sectional retrospective study is that remotely-collected biomechanical walking data are significantly associated with individuals' self-evaluated function as defined by LEFS categorization (n = 132) and many variables differ between groups. Velocity was found to have the strongest effect size.When patients are classified according to subjective mobility level, there are significant differences in quantitative measures of ambulation analyzed with smartphone-based technology. Capturing real-time information about movement is important to obtain accurate impressions of how individuals perform in daily life while understanding the relationship between enacted activity and relevant clinical outcomes.

AB  - The aim of this research is to measure the influence of social downgrading on consumer values and practices. Intergenerational mobility is defined as a process leading to a change in social status from parents to children. The first part of this paper presents social mobility and emphasises its multi-dimensional character. In particular, we detail the different types of objective and subjective mobility. In the second part, we analyse the symbolic and psychological aspects of the acceptance or rejection of social downgrading. We present the results of an exploratory study based on the life stories of a dozen families. It appears that some downgraded individuals do not accept to give up the lifestyle inherited from their childhood and perceive it as an intimate part of their identity. Others, on the contrary, rebuild new identities and modes of consumption based on a "reappropriation of their declassification". This study provides a better understanding of social downgrading by presenting it as a complex process combining the incorporation of a new social status, transgenerational capital and new forms of consumer resistance.

AB  - Abstract Background Multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurological disease that affects the central nervous system, resulting in various symptoms. Among these, impaired mobility and fatigue stand out as the most prevalent. The progressive worsening of symptoms adversely alters quality of life, social interactions and participation in activities of daily living. The main objective of this study is to bring new insights into the impact of a multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation on supervised walking tests, physical activity (PA) behavior and everyday gait patterns. Methods A total of 52 patients, diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, were evaluated before and after 3 weeks of inpatient rehabilitation. Each measurement period consisted of clinical assessments and 7 days home monitoring using foot-mounted sensors. In addition, we considered two subgroups based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores: ‘mild’ (EDSS &lt; 5) and ‘severe’ (EDSS ≥ 5) disability levels. Results Significant improvements in fatigue, quality of life and perceived mobility were reported. In addition, walking capacity, as assessed by the 10-m walking test, two-minute walk test and timed-up-and-go test, improved significantly after rehabilitation. Regarding the home assessment, mildly disabled patients significantly increased their locomotion per day and complexity of daily PA pattern after rehabilitation, while severely disabled patients did not significantly change. There were distinct and significant differences in gait metrics (i.e., gait speed, stride length, cadence) between mildly and severely disabled patients, but the statistical models did not show a significant overall rehabilitation effect on these gait metrics. Conclusion Inpatient rehabilitation showed beneficial effects on self-reported mobility, self-rated health questionnaires, and walking capacity in both mildly and severely disabled patients. However, these improvements do not necessarily translate to home performance in severely disabled patients, or only marginally in mildly disabled patients. Motivational and behavioral factors should also be considered and incorporated into treatment strategies.

AB  - M-governance mainly facilitates government to public (G2P) and public to government (P2G) communication for better public service in terms of information transmission and dissemination. This research aims to develop a m-governance framework and architecture for mobile governance to enhance the communication services of the University in the domain of Admission, Affiliation, Curriculum, Examination, Result and General Inquiry. Proposed m-governance framework build-up on the basis of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and 15 enabler including perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived access, interpersonal influence, perceived trustworthiness, perceived mobility, transparency of governance, compatibility, flexibility, perceived security, perceived enjoyment, network provider service, completeness of service, location influence in the service and emergency management. Proposed application architecture for mobile governance is beneficial because it allows administrators of the affiliated colleges to use the mobile device of their choice but Android, and it offers a simple solution. The analysis of the data reveals that the administrators as well as academician are inclined to have mobile governance for enhancing the communication services of the higher educational system.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of the interrelation between different types of social mobility and support for reducing income inequality in contemporary Russia. Drawing from the Russian subsets of the International Social Survey Programme’s (ISSP) surveys, we estimate how this support is differentiated across experienced and expected subjective mobility. Official statistics and empirical survey data widely confirm that the large-scale socioeconomic changes that took place in Russia during the 2000s brought an increase in living standards for most population groups and a more-than-twofold reduction in poverty. However, according to the ISSP data, demand for the government to reduce income differences is at its highest level since 1992. More than 90 per cent of Russians unequivocally perceive income gaps in the country as too high (the same as in the late 1990s) and unfair. We test the effects of actual and expected mobility, showing that, in contrast to the literature, including earlier studies on Russia, past mobility and expected medium-term mobility do not have any significant effect on levels of support for reducing income differences, and only the effect of short-term expectations can be seen. We argue that the effect of social mobility in Russia is limited by a widespread consensus across the population that preexisting inequalities in Russia are too high and unfair – a viewpoint based mostly not on the specifics of individual situations, including experienced or expected mobility, but on shared subjective norms and beliefs about inequality and their contrast with existing reality.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate changes in walking levels of independently mobile individuals following a stroke between the inpatient setting and the home environment, both directly after discharge and in the longer term. Forty-three participants who had a stroke as their primary diagnosis and who could walk 10 metres without the support of another person on discharge from hospital completed the study. The Step-Watch Activity Monitor, six minute walk test, 10 metre walk test, and the Stroke Impact Scale were used to measure outcome. There was a significant increase in number of steps taken per day between 3–14 days and 4–6 months post-discharge (p = 0.0001). Walking speed, six minute walk test, perceived mobility and perceived ability to perform activities of daily living all had strong positive correlations with average amount of steps at 4–6 months post-discharge from hospital and could therefore be used as predictors of walking level in the longer term. However, step counts are still below those required for health benefits. This suggests it is beneficial for further emphasis to be placed on increasing activity levels for people after stroke, even if they are able to mobilise independently on discharge home.

AB  - Many older adults receiving hemodialysis have mobility limitations and rely on care partners, yet data are sparse regarding the support provided by care partners. Our aim was to examine how care partners support the mobility of an older adult receiving hemodialysis.Qualitative study.Using purposive sampling, we recruited persons aged 60 years or more receiving maintenance hemodialysis and care partners aged 18 years or more who were providing support to an older adult receiving hemodialysis. We conducted in-person semi-structured interviews about mobility with each individual.We conducted descriptive and focused coding of interview transcripts and employed thematic analysis. Our outcome was to describe perceived mobility supports provided by care partners using qualitative themes.We enrolled 31 older adults receiving hemodialysis (42% women, 68% Black) with a mean age of 73 ± 8 years and a mean dialysis duration of 4.6 ± 3.5 years. Of these, 87% of patients used assistive devices and 90% had care partners. We enrolled 12 care partners (75% women, 33% Black) with a mean age of 54 ± 16 years. From our patient and care partner interviews, we found three themes: (1) what care partners see, (2) what care partners do, and (3) what care partners feel. Regarding what they see, care partners witness a decline in patient mobility. Regarding what they do, care partners guide and facilitate activities and manage others who also assist. Regarding what they feel, care partners respect the patient's autonomy but experience frustration and worry about the patient's future mobility.Modest sample size; single geographic area.In older adults receiving hemodialysis, care partners observe a decline in mobility and provide support for mobility. They respect the patient's autonomy but worry about future mobility losses. Future research should incorporate care partners in interventions that address mobility in older adults receiving hemodialysis.

AB  - 1980’li yıllarda, adını Arap sözcüğünün hecelerinin yer değiştirilmesiyle elde edilen Verlan Dili ile bu süreçte gelişen Beur Yazını, yeni bir yazar kuşağını yazın evrenine taşımıştır. Beur yazını, Kuzey Afrika kökenli ya da Fransa'da doğup büyüyen Kuzey Afrika göçerlerinin özgün söylemidir. Göçün etkisiyle sömürgecilik sonrası ortaya çıkan bu yazınsal akımın romanlarının genç anlatı kişileri, sürekli bir iç çatışma içinde olup, iki ekin, iki yaşam ve iki toplum arasında algılanan göç acısı, eşitsizlik ve sömürgeleştirme duygusu içinde parçalanırlar. Özellikle 2005 yılından başlayarak, Yörekent Yazını, daha sonra da Çağdaş Kent Yazını ya da Dünya-Yazını olarak tanımlanan metinler, yazın ve dilbilim dünyasında bütünüyle yeni bir araştırma ve eleştiri nesnesi olarak belirmiştir. Beur Yazını romanlarında yazar, farklı kökenlerden, ekinlerden ve Arapça, Berber, Afrika ve Karayip ile Çingene dillerinden oluşan toplulukların dil uygulamalarını birlikte kullanarak çoğul ve karma yeni bir dilsel / söylemsel uzam oluşturmuştur. Biz bu çalışmada Mağrip ülkelerinden ulusötesi göç sonrası Fransa’da gelişen Beur yazını ve Verlan dilini, tarihsel ve kuramsal bağlamda incelemeyi amaçlıyoruz. Beur literature and Verlan language: North African Mover Discourse in France In the 1980s, Beur literature, whose name was derived by the displacement of syllables of the Arabic word, referred to as the Verlan language, carried a new generation of writers into the literary universe. Beur literature is the narrative language of North African movers/immigrants of North African descent or born and raised in France. The young narrative persons of the novels of this literary current, which are brought about by the influence of mobility, are in constant internal conflict, falling apart in a sense of perceived mobility burden, inequality, and colonization between two cultures, two lives, and two societies. Especially beginning in 2005, texts described as suburban literature have emerged as an entirely new object of research and criticism in the world of literature and linguistics. In Beur literature novels, the author has created a new linguistic space, plural and mixed, using the linguistic practices of communities of different origins, cultures and languages such as Arabic, Berber, African and Caribbean languages, and the languages of the Gypsy genre together. In this study, we aim to focus on the main aspects of bilingualism, multiculturalism, the search for identity, double alienation, expatriation, acculturation and harmony that the representatives of this paper focus on, after examining the Beur literature that developed in the Francophone literature with its historical and theoretical dimensions.

AB  - Aging is often associated with declines in sensory (e.g., hearing), cognitive, and motor functioning. These functions jointly influence one’s ability to engage successfully in everyday activities (i.e., communication) and avoid injury (i.e., falls-related injuries). Previous studies have typically assessed these abilities independently of each other (rather than holistically), focused on impairments (rather than healthy older adults) and used objective assessments (rather than subjective assessments). This study aimed to fill these gaps by examining the hearing-cognition-mobility link with healthy older adult participants ranging in hearing abilities. Retrospective analyses were conducted on an existing dataset collected within our laboratory at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, which included an in-person objective-measures session (n= 122) and an online subjective-measures session (n= 41) measuring hearing, cognition and mobility. We conducted bivariate correlations and found that better objective hearing was associated with better objective cognition, better subjective hearing was associated with better subjective cognition and better subjective mobility, and poorer subjective cognition was associated with better objective mobility. Using a series of stepwise backward linear regressions, we found that better subjective hearing predicted both better subjective cognition and better subjective mobility. These findings may have implications for early screening and intervention strategies for adults experiencing subtle sensory-cognitive-motor declines.

AB  - The 21st century has witnessed a substantial increase in research focused on the benefits of bilingualism for individuals. The aspects that have received the most attention have been executive functions. And communication skills. Less is known, however, about the noncognitive and nonlinguistic aspects of bilingualism. Personality psychologists claim that personality is the result of a combination of nature-related and nurture-related factors, but the latter have not been sufficiently addressed in studies on bilingualism. Thus, to bridge this gap, the present contribution pursues this line of inquiry by adopting a quantitative approach to the examination of the self-perceived mobility, employability, and intercultural competence of participants who studied in a bilingual education program. A total of 835 respondents living in Brazil completed an online questionnaire. Mann–Whitney U and Wilcoxon W tests showed higher scores for bilingual graduates than for their nonbilingual counterparts on the three subscales. Correlation analyses revealed moderate-to-high positive correlations between bilingual graduates’ perception of their way of being and their way of life on the one hand, and among their self-perceived mobility, employability, and intercultural competence on the other. Likewise, the analyses showed statistically significant positive correlations between being proficient in more than one foreign language and the dimension of mobility. Our findings illustrate the influence that bilingualism/multilingualism exerts on factors that determine everyday life and corroborate and expand the research conducted in this strand. Avenues for further related research are discussed.

AB  - Mobile technologies have rapidly gained widespread adoption and provide significant advantages for businesses, including the ability to reach customers more effectively. These technologies offer numerous benefits, such as the ability to interact from virtually anywhere, individualized usage, personalized information and services, and prompt responses. The advancement of mobile technology has facilitated the transition from traditional to digital payment systems. For example, in Nepal, the mobile payment system "eSewa" was introduced by eSewa Fonepay in 2009. Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in e-commerce, largely driven by the pervasive use of mobile devices. This surge in online trading has led to the development of new products and solutions for online payments, influencing consumer attitudes and behaviors. An online survey of 165 individuals was done for the study. Correlation and regression analysis were performed in SPSS was used for the data analysis. The study identified several factors influencing adoption: perceived reputation, perceived trust, environmental risk, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived mobility. Findings revealed that perceived reputation, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness positively affect attitudes towards digital payments. Notably, perceived usefulness had the greatest impact on fostering a positive attitude, while perceived trust, environmental risk, and perceived mobility did not show significant effects.

AB  - This chapter considers the omnibus as a central urban site where class relations and class identity were articulated, debated, and contested. Contemporary writers noted that the name omnibus was particularly well-suited to a mode of public transport that was by law open to everyone regardless of class, rank, or social standing. In theory, this vehicle embodied democratic promise, class equality, and French Republican values. Yet a careful analysis of contemporary documents shows that the omnibus was a much more ambivalent class signifier than heretofore believed. While some works hailed it as a symbol of progress and democratic potential, a space in which social distinctions became irrelevant, and all passengers were treated equally, others bemoaned that the omnibus fell short as a vehicle of equality. Finally, some documents reveal a profound anxiety about class mixing aboard the omnibus, which for many symbolized the upending of existing social hierarchies. The omnibus was thus a locus for engaging with both class aspirations and class anxieties. Some urban observers perceived social mobility as a promise, while others saw it as a dangerous challenge to the social order.

AB  - The article describes the content, the methodology and the selected results deriving from a large-scale cross-sectional IneqPer survey in Italy (n = 12,000, 2024/2025) aimed at understanding the determinants of inequality perceptions and their consequences for public opinion. The dataset offers novel dimensions that include the questions on global inequality and global redistribution, individual position in global distribution, the perceived social mobility in the society, perceived gender inequality and perceptions of discrimination against immigrants, among others. Moreover, for a number of questions, it offers a possibility of cross-validation with a range of recent datasets including European Social Survey (2020), European Value Study (2017), and the International Social Survey Program (2019). The first results show that Italians indeed recognize inequality along all dimensions (e.g., socio-economic inequality, gender inequality and inequality between migrants and natives), yet they do not strongly perceive themselves as personally affected by discrimination. Moreover, although cross-validation checks reveal a strong alignment between IneqPer data and other international value surveys, respondents in the IneqPer dataset tend to express slightly more progressive views.

AB  - An efficient mobility is essential to stay connected to community services and to participate in social interaction. However, mobility is impeded by age-related changes regarding perceptual, cognitive, and physical abilities that make older drivers and pedestrians overrepresented in road casualties. At the same time, self-awareness of these limitations frequently may lead to excessive fears (e.g., fear of falling) and self-imposed mobility reduction such as driving cessation that increases the risk of home confinement and social exclusion. This presentation offers an overview of these objective and subjective mobility limitations and their interaction. This is a necessary first step towards developing efficient actions aimed at improving both mobility and safety of older adults. Consequently, we explore in a second step how the socio-spatial environment can be adapted at different levels (e.g., social policy, road environment design) to become a more age-friendly space and as a consequence promote social inclusion in later life.

AB  - Background: Energy storing and return (ESAR) prosthetic feet often provide high energy return at the cost of increased foot height, compromised appearance, and reduced flexibility. An ESAR foot, Ottobock Evanto, with a novel compact design has been introduced (novel foot). Objective: To characterize user preference and benefits of a novel foot compared with the subject's previously worn (everyday foot) and comparator foot, Össur Pro-Flex XC. Study Design: Multicenter, randomized, nonblinded, cross-over trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05628064). Methods: Transtibial amputees using ESAR feet were eligible. Outcome measures included perceived mobility, the extent of meeting amputees' needs, pain intensity, EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, pain interference, foot preference, and walking experience. The first 3 measures with the novel foot vs. the everyday and comparator feet were used for primary objectives. Results: Data from 20 participants were analyzed. For all primary outcomes, improved scores while wearing the novel foot were obtained. The change in perceived mobility vs. the everyday foot score was highly significant ( P = 0.0007). The novel foot was the most preferred foot overall (55% participants) and for many activities, e.g., walking on inclines (85%) and over uneven terrain (70%). Participants confirmed that the novel foot made walking up slopes easier (95%), standing more flexible (85%), and heel strike more comfortable (85%) vs. their everyday feet. Conclusions: The novel foot offers advantages compared with the tested feet, including making walking on uneven terrain and slopes easier and more comfortable heel strike. Activities in which the novel foot would perform worse than the other feet have not been reported.

AB  - Designing mobility experiences is complex. Technical issues can be out of a designer’s scope or require the long-term development of solutions.Emotions and contexts shapeuser perceptions ofexperiences–the stronger the emotional reaction, the better people remember theexperience. In thisexploratory study, the focusis on the research stage of the design process and seeks to identify and characterise the interactions leading to emotional responses in users’ mobility experiences. Three methods were applied to two studies inSingapore and Paris, France to collect people’s lived experiences with mobility: diarycards, user journey maps and text stimuli. Results showed that people tend not to perceive mobility experiences emotionally. When they do, the emotions trend negativelydue to deviations from expectedservice performance. Anevaluation of the methods used led toa proposed set of parameters for the developmentof a tool to design emotionalexperiences

AB  - Microprocessor-controlled knee joints are one of the most widely adopted modern prosthetic technologies. As a profession, it is important to define the functional value associated with this intervention to the larger rehabilitation community. Further, the profession has a responsibility to define which patient characteristics will best determine those individuals most likely to benefit from this intervention. Published literature to date provides some insight into the domains in which the benefits of the knee joints might be most readily observed. These include increased perceived mobility, reduced cognitive demand, and increased sense of well-being. The common practice of defining candidacy for this technology based exclusively on considerations of gait velocity fails to consider many of the documented benefits associated with the use of this technology. Rather, candidacy seems to be a product of an individual’s abilities, expected activities, and physical deficits.

AB  - M-governance mainly facilitates government to public (G2P) and public to government (P2G) communication for better public service in terms of information transmission and dissemination. This research aims to develop a m-governance framework and architecture for mobile governance to enhance the communication services of the University in the domain of Admission, Affiliation, Curriculum, Examination, Result and General Inquiry. Proposed m-governance framework build-up on the basis of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and 15 enabler including perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived access, interpersonal influence, perceived trustworthiness, perceived mobility, transparency of governance, compatibility, flexibility, perceived security, perceived enjoyment, network provider service, completeness of service, location influence in the service and emergency management. Proposed application architecture for mobile governance is beneficial because it allows administrators of the affiliated colleges to use the mobile device of their choice but Android, and it offers a simple solution. The analysis of the data reveals that the administrators as well as academician are inclined to have mobile governance for enhancing the communication services of the higher educational system.

AB  - This paper explored students’ experiences in an international virtual student mobility (VSM) program at a Japanese national university implemented in collaboration with partner universities in the Asia Pacific region and Europe. Through students’ narratives, the study discerned how students perceive “mobility” and the concept of “international students” after participating in a virtual student mobility program. Findings revealed a tension between students’ understanding of “mobility,” official narratives, and students’ actual experiences. While VSM programs facilitate communication and knowledge exchange across borders and develop cross-cultural communications, prevailing binary definitions in student mobility, such as “inbound” vs. “outbound,” “domestic” vs. “international,” or “study abroad” vs. “internationalization at home,” limit VSM potential to be fully realized. This misalignment of the traditional understanding of student mobility that emphasizes place and borders challenges the official narrative of student mobility and urges educators to re-align and re-frame how we understand “international students.”

AB  - The article substantiates the author’s interpretation of labor mobility potential and the factors of its activation in line with the subjective mobility concept. Its empirical verification is carried out on the basis of the analysis of the mass survey data and in-depth interviews conducted by the author among the young people employed in the economy of Kursk region, and their comparison with the results of all-Russian and regional studies. The research reveals a relatively high potential for labor mobility of working youth, expressed in the readiness to change jobs in the near future. About half of the young people employed in the economy can be attributed to the social base of potential labor mobility, within which there are two significant groups: some of them have a clearly defined attitude to change jobs in the near future, the second one allows such changes in their employment status. It determines the key role of two groups of factors in activating the potential of youth labor mobility. The first of them includes the intentions of young people to realize themselves and their professional potential in labor activity and career in a new job; the second one is represented by the main reasons for dissatisfaction with the working conditions at the current job – the level of wages and the amount of workload. The research establishes the prevalence in the youth environment of employment not according to the profile of the received profession (specialty), and young people’s lack of assessment of the discrepancy between work and profession as a causal factor for changing jobs and as an obstacle to their career.

AB  - Language death in modern African societies presents a critical challenge, reflecting a complex interplay of historical, socioeconomic, and cultural factors that threaten the survival of indigenous languages. The legacy of colonialism and globalisation has resulted in the dominance of foreign languages, such as English, French, and Portuguese, over local languages, leading to significant language endangerment and loss. This phenomenon erodes linguistic diversity and undermines cultural Identity, as many communities increasingly adopt these global languages for perceived social mobility and economic advantages. The current state of language death in Africa is alarming, with UNESCO estimating that approximately 40% of the world's 6,700 languages are endangered, many of which are indigenous African languages. Factors contributing to this decline include urbanisation, cultural assimilation, and the influence of mass media favouring dominant languages, often at the expense of local dialects. As younger generations migrate to urban centres in search of opportunities, the transmission of native languages is disrupted, raising concerns about the loss of unique cultural knowledge and oral histories accompanying these languages. In addressing this crisis, the responsibility for curbing language death is increasingly viewed as a parental duty. Parents play a pivotal role in fostering the use of Indigenous languages within the home and community, ensuring that their children appreciate and engage with their linguistic heritage. Initiatives aimed at revitalising endangered languages often emphasise the importance of parental involvement in language preservation, encouraging practices such as storytelling and community engagement to promote cultural continuity. Efforts to combat language death in Africa are gaining traction through various means, including government policies, educational reforms, and technological innovations. Collaborative strategies that involve community participation and advocacy for Indigenous languages within educational curricula are critical for ensuring the survival of linguistic diversity on the continent. As the dialogue surrounding language death evolves, the importance of collective action, both at the familial and societal levels, remains vital to preserving Africa's rich tapestry of languages and cultures.

AB  - This study examines how upward social mobility shapes Chinese women’s workplace experiences by applying social comparison theory and asking which structural-related factors most strongly influence women’s perceptions of—and strategies for—occupational advancement in contemporary China. Employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on 4,043 Zhihu comments under the “involution” discussion, we identify five operational dimensions—economic reward–value alignment, work burden, institutional environment, resource distribution, and individual agency—that collectively explain variation in perceived mobility opportunities. Our results show that misalignment between compensation and perceived professional worth, coupled with excessive instructional and emotional labor, constitutes a primary barrier, whereas supportive institutional policies and strong professional identity mitigate constraints. These findings offer actionable insights for policymakers and educational leaders to reform compensation structures and workload management, thereby fostering more equitable career advancement for women in China.

Using both rounds of the Life in Transition Survey, the paper builds measures of downward mobility for about 57,000 individuals from 27 countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The analysis finds that more intensive, recent, and persistent downward mobility increases support for redistribution more. A number of extensions and checks are done by, among others, taking into account systematic bias in perceived mobility experience, considering an alternative definition of redistributive preferences, and exploring the severity of omitted variable bias problems. Overall, the results are robust.

AB  - The factors that impact the willingness of Vietnamese secondary school students to embrace mobile learning are examined in this study using the framework of the technology acceptance model (TAM). The study utilized a quantitative research approach, and data were gathered accordingly from 611 students via structured questionnaires. The research focused on critical variables, including perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived mobility (PM), social influence (SI), self-efficacy (SE), learning autonomy (LA), and perceived enjoyment (PE). Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was utilized to analyze the relationships among these variables. The findings revealed that PU, PEU, and PE significantly affect students’ behavioral intention (BI) to adopt mobile learning. At the same time, external factors such as PM, SI, SE, and LA indirectly shape PU and PEU. These results deepen the understanding of mobile learning adoption within the Vietnamese educational context and underscore the need for targeted policy development to foster student engagement with mobile technologies. This study contributes to the broader educational technology literature, offering valuable insights for educators and policymakers aiming to optimize learning experiences through mobile platforms.

AB  - Abstract In the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) World Report on Aging and Health, mobility is described as movement in all its forms either powered by the body or by a vehicle. Mobility thus encompasses basic movements such as standing up from a chair to more complex activities such as walking or using transportation. Many outcome measures have been developed to assess mobility, however, the variability in constructs being assessed and lack of standardisation in terminology present challenges to advance research and practice in this area. We propose a unified framework for mobility measurement in older populations consistent with the latest language and terminology endorsed by the WHO. The framework outlines three distinct constructs: perceived mobility (“what can you do?”), locomotor capacity for mobility (“what could you do?”), and actual mobility (“what do you do in daily life?”). The latter construct, actual mobility, has been less well studied until recently. Wearable devices offer the unique advantage of comprehensively monitoring the real-world actual mobility of older people in their homes and communities. In this talk, we will present emerging data from the McMaster Monitoring My Mobility (MacM3) study, a digital mobility cohort of over 1200 community-dwelling older adults with detailed mobility measurements spanning all three aspects of mobility and examine their relationships with clinically important health outcomes. In this way, we will be able to test the suitability of our framework and highlight the potential of digitally derived measures of actual mobility for informing aging research and practice.

KW  - Prosocial Behavior
AB  - ABSTRACT This study introduces a novel framework for understanding how social norms and economic perceptions interact to shape prosocial behavior. Specifically, it examines how class‐based charitable norms and individuals’ perceived economic mobility jointly influence conformity to prosocial standards. Perceived economic mobility—the belief in one's potential for upward social movement—emerges as a powerful psychological lens through which people interpret and respond to norms. Individuals who see upward mobility as attainable are more likely to adopt the charitable behaviors of higher‐income groups, whereas those who feel economically constrained align with the prosocial norms of middle‐ or lower‐income classes. This effect is mediated by perceptions of prosociality within one's chosen reference group and is moderated by temporal orientation: individuals with a stronger present‐focus are less influenced by future‐oriented mobility considerations. These findings offer new insights into consumer decision‐making, social influence, and identity‐driven behavior. They also carry practical implications for nonprofit marketing and corporate social responsibility. Charities and brands can strategically shape prosocial engagement by aligning messages with audiences’ mobility beliefs—using aspirational appeals for those with high perceived mobility and emphasizing solidarity and community for those with lower mobility perceptions. By highlighting how anticipated economic identity shapes behavior more than current status, this study provides a generalizable and actionable framework for promoting charitable giving and prosocial behavior across socioeconomic contexts.

AB  - Introduction: Assessing an individuals physical capacity to move independently and safely to perform activities of daily living (i.e., functional mobility) can be approached through various modalities, including performance-based physiological tests, observational assessments, and self-report questionnaires. The purpose of this study was to establish a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), termed PROWalk, based on the PROMIS Item Bank 2.0 - Physical Function, to assess perceived mobility challenges, specifically related to gait and balance function, and evaluate its performance in comparison to the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) within a population of individuals with sensory peripheral neuropathy. Methods: The PROWalk PROM was developed with expert clinician input as a custom short form composed of selected items from the Item Bank. Participants with lower extremity peripheral neuropathy who had been prescribed a wearable sensory prosthesis were administered the PROWalk and the PSFS, a perceived functional mobility assessment via telecommunications at baseline and six weeks after wearing the sensory prosthesis. Results: Both measures displayed significant increases (i.e., improvements) over time with large effect sizes and upward linear trends for each instrument between baseline and six weeks. When normalized, the measures showed no bias, large limits of agreement, and no normalized change between the instruments. Discussion: The PROWalk PROM detected significant improvements in perceived functional mobility over time and showed strong temporal stability and suitability for standardized group-level comparisons, which were similar to the PSFS. Overall, the PROWalk appears to be a valid PROM for capturing improvements in self-reported functional mobility related to gait and balance function.

AB  - In diesem Beitrag wird das Konzept der Bedürfnisorientierung im Zusammenhang mit der In-tegration von On-Demand-Angeboten in den ÖPNV beleuchtet, illustriert am Beispiel des Lübecker Mobilitätsprojekts "in2Lübeck" mit dem On-Demand-Ridepooling-Angebot Lümo. Zentral ist hierbei die Fragestellung, wie bedürfnisorientierte Mobilitätslösungen die Zufrie-denheit und Attraktivität des öffentlichen Personennahverkehrs, insbesondere außerhalb der Hauptverkehrszeiten, steigern können. Als innovatives Angebot ergänzt Lümo den traditionel-len öffentlichen Linienverkehr in Lübeck und verbindet die Flexibilität des eigenen Autos mit den Vorteilen des öffentlichen Nahverkehrs. Bei der Weiterentwicklung des Ridepooling-An-gebots in Lübeck steht primär die Berücksichtigung von Bedürfnissen wie dem Gefühl von Autonomie, Verbundenheit und Sicherheit im Vordergrund. Um diese Aspekte in der Mobilität messbar und quantifizierbar zu machen, wurde die Skala "Perceived Mobility Need Satisfac-tion" (PMNS) entwickelt. Die Ergebnisse einer umfangreichen Panelstudie zeigen, dass Ange-bote von On-Demand-Ridepooling wie Lümo in Bedürfnisbereichen wie Autonomie, Sicher-heit und Vergnügen, die Lücke zwischen dem privaten PKW und dem traditionellen Linienver-kehr schließen können. Damit kann einerseits der Weg geebnet sein für einen Verzicht auf den motorisierten Individualverkehr, und andererseits für den Umstieg auf öffentliche Verkehrsmit-tel. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass der On-Demand-Ridepooling-Verkehr eine viel-versprechende Ergänzung zum traditionellen Linienverkehr bietet und eine bedürfnisorientierte Weiterentwicklung dieses Angebots eine Schlüsselrolle der nachhaltigen Mobilitätswende spie-len kann.

AB  - Background Subcutaneous foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (LDp/CDp) has expanded the treatment options in advanced Parkinson’s disease (aPD). However, the most appropriate therapeutic setting for therapy implementation is not clear. Objective To present a concept for LDp/CDp therapy implementation in a Parkinson’s day-clinic and efficacy and safety outcome data from patients under the new therapeutic regimen. Methods Retrospective clinical data were collected from the first 24 patients with aPD who were initiated on LDp/CDp treatment at the Hamburg Parkinson’s day-clinic. Outcome parameters were analyzed in terms of motor symptoms (MDS -UPDRS II-IV), safety aspects and effects on patients’ quality of life (PDQ-39). Results The concept of the Parkinson’s Day-clinic enabled the successful implementation of LDp/CDp therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (aPD). It provided individualized medical supported via neurologists, specialized nurses and therapists and thus facilitated the transition from clinic-based care to home-based support. Compared to previous optimized oral treatment, the application of LDp/CDp significantly reduced motor complications such as dyskinesias and motor fluctuations by 53% on the MDS-UPDRS IV ( p = 0.0094). Motor function improvements were paralleled by a numerical increase in activities of daily living scores (MDS-UPDRS II) and improvement in long-term mobility (PDQ-39 mobility subscale), suggesting potential benefits in daily functioning and perceived mobility. Conclusion The value of our data is limited by its retrospective design and small sample size. However, the data suggest that a proper day-clinic setting enables the successful implementation of subcutaneous LDp/CDp therapy with improvement of motor functions and reduction of side effects. It also ensures the necessary intensive medical support and offers comprehensive device-related and psychosocial guidance for both patients and caregivers.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: This chapter analyses the effects of social stratification and inequalities on the outcomes of transnational mobilities, especially on the educational trajectory of returning migrant children.Study approach: It places the Bourdieusian capital concepts (Bourdieu, 1977, 1984) centre stage, and analyses the convertibility or transferability of the cultural and social capital across different transnational locations. It examines the serious limitations of this process, using the concept of non-dominant cultural capital as a heuristic analytical tool and the education system (school) as a way of approaching the field. As we examine ‘successful mobilities’ of high-status families with children and racialised low-status families experiencing mobility failures, our intention is to draw attention on the effect of the starting position of the migrating families on the outcomes of their cross-border mobilities through a closer reading of insightful cases. We look at the interrelations of social position or class race and mobility experiences through several empirical case studies from different regions of Hungary by examining the narratives of people belonging to very different social strata with a focus on the ‘top’ and the ‘bottom’ of the socio-economic hierarchy. We examine the transnational mobility trajectories, strategies and the reintegration of school age children from transnationally mobile families upon their return to Hungary.Findings: Our qualitative research indicates that for returning migrants not only their available capitals in a Bourdieasian sense but also their (de)valuation by the different Hungarian schools has direct consequences on mobility-affected educational trajectories, on the individual outcomes of mobilities, and the circumstances of return and chances for reintegration.Originality: There is little qualitative research on the effects of emigration from Hungary in recent decades. A more recent edited volume (Váradi, 2018) discusses various intersectionalities of migration such as gender, ethnicity and age. This chapter intends to advance this line of research, analysing the intersectionality of class, ethnicity and race in the context of spatial mobilities through operationalising a critical reading of the Bourdieusian capitals.

Introduction The aim of this chapter is to show how migration experience provides both opportunities and difficulties for families with distinct resources. We examine it from the perspective of school reintegration of children from transnationally mobile families upon their return to Hungary. We explore the parents’, children’s and teachers’ narratives about ‘losses’ and ‘gains’ linked to geographical mobilities. While families and children with more resources tend to profit more from their experiences abroad, a more nuanced and critical understanding of the Bourdieusian concepts of social, cultural and economic capitals provides us with a better understanding of the impacts of migration on school performance, and ultimately on the successful return and reintegration of children. Looking at migration, as a hope or opportunity (Durst, 2018), and including aspirational capital (Yosso, 2005) as an important alternative form of cultural capital provides new insights about the advantages and disadvantages of the mobility experience. Aspirational capital ‘refers to the ability to maintain hopes and dreams for the future, even in the face of real and perceived barriers’ (Yosso, 2005, p. 77). Studying aspirational capital in the case of returning children provides a valuable contribution to a deeper understanding of the impact of transnational migration on the future perspectives of children. To meet the aims of this chapter, we draw on the empirical findings of two of our research projects. The first one investigated the difficulties of school reintegration in the case of return migrant children from different socio-economical family backgrounds in Hungary. In the framework of this project, we conducted interviews with teachers and children in three sites including an elite private school, one serving middle class children and a third school serving children of socially marginalised Roma families. The second research project that this chapter benefits from incorporated two years of ethnographic field work in an impoverished rural town in North East Hungary. The chapter proceeds in the following way. First, we delineate the theoretical framework that we use as a conceptual toolkit to interpret our empirical findings. Then, we introduce the research context, the background of transnational migration from Hungary and some important characteristics of the education system in the country. Third, we develop our argument by showcasing three case studies from the top, the middle and the low end of the Hungarian education system, in different school environments with elite and disadvantaged students. Finally, we conclude the chapter with theoretical and practical implications following from our empirical findings. Theoretical Framework: Transnational Migration, (Non) Dominant Cultural Capital, and Social Position The gains and losses of migration are commonly analysed in a theoretical framework based on Bourdieu’s concepts of social, economic and cultural capital that examines whether migration can provide a way for social mobility. As Burke, Thatcher, Ingram, and Abrahams (2016) explain, capital can be understood as particular resources that individuals have access to, which can be invested or exchanged. These resources locate an individual’s position within a social hierarchy or a social space. The position an individual occupies in society will affect not only one’s life chances but also one’s level of aspirations and expectations from life, what Bourdieu (1984) refers to as the ‘field of possibles’ (p. 110). Bourdieu (1984, 1989) identifies four different types of capital: economic, cultural, social and symbolic. Economic capital describes different forms of material possessions. Social capital refers to resources based on connections and group membership. Cultural capital refers to the accumulated cultural knowledge and skills and can exist in three forms. The first one is the embodied state, in the form of long-lasting dispositions of the mind and body, such as social styles, schemes of expression, acquired bodies of knowledge, manners of speaking, representational styles, consumption practices and patterns (Reay, 2004; Skeggs, 1997; Wallace, 2016). The second one is the objectified state, in the form of cultural goods (books, etc.). The third one is the institutionalised state, such as educational qualifications. The fourth type of the Bourdieusian capitals’ is the symbolic capital. This is the form the other types of capitals take once they are perceived and recognised as legitimate. As Skeggs (1997) explains, legitimation is the key mechanism in the capital conversion to power. ‘Cultural capital has to be legitimated before it can be capitalized upon. All capitals are context specific’ (Skeggs, 1997, p. 8). Thus, people are distributed in the overall social space according to the volume and composition of their legitimised capital in their different social contexts. Despite Bourdieu’s nuanced and specific definition, his concept of cultural capital is commonly deployed in ways that promote deficit views of racial and class minorities (Wallace, 2016). Conventional studies on socio-economically disadvantaged working class and racialised minority families describe this group with a deficit view: lack of economic and cultural capital and low aspirations (see for a critic Mallman, 2018; McKenzie, 2016; Yosso, 2005). Ethnographic studies, however, show that there are two core forms of cultural capital at play in the lives of racialised minorities. Carter (2003, cited by Wallace, 2016) speaks about dominant and non-dominant cultural capital. That is, the legitimated (dominant) and non-legitimated (non-dominant, or alternative forms of) cultural capital. She defines dominant cultural capital in keeping with Bourdieu’s original definition – that is cultural knowledge, specialised skills and distinct practices (and tastes) inherited and used by privileged classes to maintain high status and reproduce power in mainstream society. Non-dominant cultural capital, on the other hand, refers to the cultural resources lower status groups convert to capital to manage their lower status within their local communities (Carter, 2003). Those who acquire dominant cultural capital at home and in social contexts such as in a school environment, experience cumulative advantage in school (Lareau, 2011). It is because (traditional) formal education inculcates dominant middle-class cultures and only value dominant (middle class) cultural capital. As Skeggs (1997, p. 129) puts it, the inability to trade one’s cultural capital because it has only limited value or is not recognised in the places where value can be accrued is a substantial disadvantage to and sign of being born working-class. In the same line of thinking, Yosso (2005) suggests, by exploring the educational success of People of Colour (as she calls the visible minority groups, often stigmatised by race), that they are not deficient of cultural capital – they just do not possess the dominant type of it. Many of these socially marginalised groups rather accrue an ‘array of cultural knowledge, skills, abilities, and contacts that often go unrecognised’ (Yosso, 2005, p. 69). Yosso calls this (by the dominated majority and by their schools) unrecognised cultural capital ‘the community cultural wealth’. Yosso (2005) elaborates on her concepts by bringing in the perspective of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and explains that ‘Communities of Color nurture cultural wealth through at least six forms of capital, such as aspirational, navigational, social, linguistic, familial and resistant capital’, which are in constant dynamic process and build on each other (Yosso, 2005, p. 77). Looking at these different forms of capital and thinking through the ‘lens’ of CRT is especially inspirational when studying the school performance of students coming from different social backgrounds, including from racialised minority groups. Scholars conceptualise migration as ‘a function of aspiration and capabilities to move within a given set of opportunity structures’ (De Haas, 2009). In line with Yosso’s reference to aspirational capital as part of community cultural wealth, they show that the capacity to aspire is of key importance to the empowerment of the poor (Appadurai, 2004). Furthermore, aspirational capital gained through migration can be a highly important, but in the literature largely neglected, advantage, especially in the case of social groups generally portrayed as ‘resourceless’, such as the Hungarian Roma. Durst provides a proactive image as she views Roma involved in migration as agents of their own mobility and shows what migration means to them. She explains transnational mobility as a ‘social practice built on hope’ (Durst, 2018). This idea is in line with Hage’s argument that ‘people engage in a physical form of mobility that we call migration because they are after existential mobility’ (Hage, 2009, p. 2). Hage understands existential mobility as a type of imagined/felt movement that is driven by the desire to avoid ‘stuckedness’, and claims that people migrate in order to constitute a more suitable space for their social and existential self. The type of life that families or people want to achieve with existential mobility can be described as a ‘life worth living’. Narotzky and Besnier (2014) analyse the strategies as to how people enhance well-being for themselves and future generations. The concepts of well-being and a life worth living do not only refer to material conditions but also to emotional and social comfort. In order to make life worth living, people invest in multiple aspects of existence that appear at first glance to have little economic substance but end up having economic consequences. Among the poor, social relations often constitute a much safer ‘investment’ than petty entrepreneurship. (Narotzky & Besnier, 2014, p. 6) As we will show based on our empirical examples, families from different social backgrounds engage in transnational migration to avoid stuckedness, but return if they feel that their existential mobility has failed for some reason (typical for elite mobilities; poor families may return for other reasons such as family relations, a rejected asylum application, etc.). Some return from their own will (elite) while others are returned due to different and constantly changing immigration policies (socially vulnerable, racialised Roma). However, what the crucial aspects are in improving their well-being, and what makes life more worth living for them abroad is very diverse and/or subjective and is not only connected to their socio-economic backgrounds but also to their individual agency and aspirations. The Research Context Transnational Migration from/to Hungary The EU accession of Central Eastern European countries and the subsequent mobility of the workforce have resulted in a multiplication of the migration patterns of the families. The number of those affected by EU migration has increased, and the mobility experiences accordingly have diversified (Koser & Lutz, 1998). The number of Hungarians moving abroad has increased considerably since 2012/2013, following the relatively low numbers since 1989 in comparison to other CEE countries. Blaskó and other sources (Blaskó, 2015) assessed the number of Hungarians moving abroad yearly to be between 50 and 100 thousand, which adds up to around a half million Hungarians residing in one of the EEA countries.1 The primary destination countries are Germany, Austria and the UK. It is important to note that the socio-demographic composition is biased towards the highly educated, young, and mobile professionals fluent in foreign languages. We may differentiate between three larger groups of Hungarians involved in international mobility, with rather distinct motivations behind migratory decisions. The decisive majority of Hungarians involved in EU mobility are guided by the gap in the labour market conditions in Hungary and the country of immigration; i.e., they find jobs or better working and financial conditions in their professions in other EU countries. Many of them are circular migrants, too, or ones who leave family members behind and commute regularly between the job and the family. A smaller group of internationally mobile Hungarians may be described as elite migrants. They possess the highest ranks within Hungarian society, with high prestige jobs but either their incomes and/or working conditions are meagre (i.e., doctors, IT, engineers) and/or sense that satisfying their professional ambitions is possible only in a more global space. Often, they also may feel that the political climate offered by the illiberal political regime is a threat in the long run for them, their profession and their families. And finally, a very specific but visible category of mobility involves Roma, many of whom experience destitute poverty and suffer everyday racialisation and discrimination. They flee from Hungary in the hope of a better, more humane life. The first and largest wave of migration of Roma took place after the 2008/2009 serial killings of Roma in Hungary and the mismanagement of the tragedy by the Hungarian authorities.2 Roma families fled to Canada and asked for asylum. Later, following the closure of the Canadian route the direction of their migration changed to the UK, where they arrived as labour migrants. The motivation behind this has, however, not changed: migrants are still looking for a place where they can have a decent life, with human dignity for them and their children. There is little qualitative research on the effects of emigration from Hungary in recent decades. A more recent edited volume (Váradi, 2018) discusses various intersectionalities of migration such as gender, ethnicity and age. Key research on Roma migration was conducted by Durst, who draws attention to the fact that the mobility of Roma is driven by intersectional disadvantages such as existential desperation, social marginalisation and racial discrimination (Bognár & Kováts, 2002; Durst, 2013, 2018; Vidra, 2013). Durst shows that for Romani families the network capital is the primary resource that they can rely on. Consequently, chain migration is a very typical mobility pattern of socially marginalised Roma. Mechanism Producing Inequality of the Education System in Hungary We examine the impact of migration experiences from the perspective of the school (re)integration of children, thus providing a short background about the Hungarian education system is necessary. The Hungarian education system is highly inequitable and selective and is among those that increases initial social inequalities among children the most in the European context (OECD, 2018; Radó, 2021; Varga, Hermann, & Horn, 2019). Mechanisms of selectivity are highly complex and include both institutional and informal processes. The most important institutional mechanisms are ethno-social segregation; the exemption of compulsory intake of children from the school’s district for faith and community schools; highly unequal financing of various types of schools by the state (i.e., per capita state financing of faith schools is more than double that of public schools) and ability grouping through various specialisations (language, sports, maths) can include or preclude children from certain backgrounds. But the most important mechanism of selectivity is informal: parents with high social and cultural capital enrol their children in prestigious schools of their choice. In rural towns these are typically the faith schools of the Protestant or Catholic Church, while in Budapest and larger towns, these include high-quality public schools, which set up various specialisations and select children through these or a community school (this later requires fees). Cultural capital is thus accumulated in a small number of schools and is transferred to children as well as into network capital that continues to impact the child’s adult life. Our research encompasses schools of different qualities and ownerships, but all of them are compulsory schools (serving children from 6 to 16) and focusses on children attending schools serving underprivileged and elite communities. But most importantly, we included schools of the three main types: public, faith and private. This is important because they typically possess different levels of autonomy and room for applying alternative (to a mainstream rigid) pedagogies, which becomes significant when it comes to the reintegration of returning children. The Hungarian education system is extremely centralised, rigid and outdated in its pedagogical approaches, preferring discipline, lexical knowledge and suppressing creativity, autonomy and critical thinking–argumenting (Moldenhawer, Miera, Kallstenius, Messing, & Schiff, 2009; Radó, 2021; Szalai & Schiff, 2014). These characteristics make it especially rigid in terms of adapting to the individual needs of children in vulnerable conditions or of any need beyond the mainstream. This involves returning migrant children, who experience different school systems and pedagogical approaches while abroad. The difference in the pedagogical approaches of Hungarian schools, where children return to, and the ones they attended while abroad (e.g., Anglo-Saxon schools in the UK and Canada where most of our interviewees returned from) makes reintegration especially difficult. Even though performance focussed education is also a problem in other countries (Neumann, 2020; Neumann, Gewirtz, Maguire, & Towers, 2020) still, UK and Canadian public schools put a much greater emphasis on problem solving, group work and critical argumentation. Meanwhile UK schools value autonomy, independence and creativity, while Hungarian schools emphasise hierarchy and discipline and expect children to acquire a large amount of lexical knowledge. Unsurprisingly, many returning children end up in some kind of alternative education: either in the form of community schools or faith schools which are less bound by rigid centralised curricula and may have more resources to support individual needs. These schools have more room to navigate the needs of their students and may take a slower pace in reintegrating them. Methods and Data Investigating the mobility experiences of adults with children poses numerous methodological challenges due to the complexity of experiences emerging from the different locations and positionality of our interlocutors. Our chapter presents the results of several research periods and two main research projects that took place between 2013 and 2020 in schools and among parents and children. Our primary aim was to understand how children and their parents perceive mobility and the changes of their various forms of capital in a Bourdieusian sense. We explored how schooling, as a major experience in a child’s life and an important source of dominant cultural capital (apart from family) shapes the future prospects of children and influences parental mobility decisions. In terms of actors or agents of transnational mobilities, in the first explorative qualitative project, we interviewed children and parents. We found them through personal contacts, or through educational institutions. Schools served as an important entry point at the beginning of our research, as we looked for localities which were well-known for their high involvement in transnational mobility, thus families and children could be reached through schools. Through this method, we could familiarise ourselves with the perspectives of teachers and the institutional understanding of these processes. During the course of research, we reached out to returning families with children through other channels as well. In our understanding, the three perspectives of parent, teacher and child have provided us with a nuanced picture of the processes of transnational mobility, the role of education in mobility decisions, the importance of children’s well-being and the role of school context in the reintegration chances of return migrant children. We looked at family mobilities and changes of capital composition in different geographical locations. We chose a location in the countryside, in North East Hungary characterised by socio-economic deprivation, marginalisation and multiple types of vulnerabilities. This settlement had a significant Roma population. The other two field sites were two schools in the capital city, Budapest. One school was situated in Pest and can be considered a middle-class institution located in a working-class neighbourhood, while the other school, situated in an up-market part of the city in Buda is a private ‘elite school’. The Pest school underwent a face-lift by adopting a bilingual (English-Hungarian) programme, which resulted in a very mixed studentship including children of the local middle-class and lower-middle class, elite children and children with immigrant backgrounds (mainly Chinese children). Apart from its bilingual programme, the school operates in its capacity as a ‘normal’ state school, with a fixed curriculum, handing down a lot of lexical knowledge and frontal teaching. On the other hand, the Buda school is sought after by the Budapest economic and intellectual elite exclusively. Families pay significant tuition fees, while the school in general applies an alternative pedagogical programme built on the liberal values of nurturing individuality, free expression of opinions and debate as the basis for learning. We have conducted profound conversations, and mostly semi-structured, narrative interviews with teachers and school directors. These conversations and interviews targeted the topics of reintegration of children, and schools’ institutional responses, pedagogical methods, ideas and teachers’ attitudes that may help the process of reintegration. It had been raised whether the school sees the years spent abroad by the children as a ‘loss’ (focussing on what the child has missed on learning material while living abroad), or as a ‘gain’ (learning a foreign language, gaining new experiences, widening the ‘horizon’). In this chapter, we also build on the empirical findings of a second research project when we construct our argument. This latter project was conducted between 2013 and 2018 in an impoverished rural town with a significant, socio-economically marginalised Roma population. The town was infamous for being one of the most ‘migration-rich’ settlements in Hungary with three quarters of its marginalised Roma population having experienced transnational migration during the last 15 years. The majority of them fled from the everyday racism and ‘racial stuckedness’ in Hungary to Canada where they claimed – typically unsuccessfully – refugee status and later many of them intermittently or circularly went on to the UK as labour migrants (Durst, 2018) in the search for a ‘life worth living’ (Narotzky & Besiner, 2014). Beyond participant observation, semi-structured interviews were conducted with local schoolteachers, returning migrant parents and their children. Results and Discussion Returning Children of the Elite in a Middle-class Bilingual School in Pest As introduced earlier, the bilingual school in Budapest has hybrid characteristics, with both middle-class and elite students in attendance. The hybrid character of the school is well-reflected in the narratives of both perspectives of teachers and children, when talking about returning children and the challenges they face in an institutional capacity. Teachers’ Perspectives Based on conversations with teachers about transnationally mobile children, it became clear that they were mainly preoccupied with the difficulties of catching up with the curriculum rather than the development and gains of children while abroad. They mostly spoke about how students can make up the missed learning materials and pass end of year exams; who helps them to catch up, if teachers have the resources for it, and who else can coach them. The time spent abroad thus primarily appeared as ‘lagging behind’ in curricular terms, or as ‘missing out’ on some lexical knowledge. We cannot excuse them for long. Tutoring works, and I would use patience instead of excuses. We are constantly improving and catching up sooner or later, because the children still act as sponges at this age. They can adapt relatively well. In some cases, the time spent abroad also results in Hungarian language problems, at the same time foreign (mostly English) language skills acquired abroad are not recognised. This reveals a one-sided approach instead of a recognition-based pedagogy. It also talks about the unrecognised forms of non-dominant cultural capital and the institutional blind-spot in this regard. There’s a girl who came last year – overall I see that she fitted in well. However, we have a school system that is very data-oriented, which is a serious problem for her. Plus, I also see that she obviously speaks Hungarian on a different level [the child lived abroad for years, she started going to school there], and that education in Hungarian is a problem for her. I see the main difficulty in this. Instead of recognition-based pedagogy a deficit-cantered thinking characterises this school. Most teachers reported that children with good learning abilities can catch up without too much difficulty, while this process is more challenging for children who already had problems in their studies. Their disadvantages continue to grow or accumulate after returning from abroad. Children labelled as ‘good students’ usually receive more support at home and have more dominant cultural and economic capital, which acts as a buffer and an important resource in times of difficulty. ‘Families resolve this’, sums up a teacher, suggesting that children and their families are left to rely on their pre-existing resources and capitals, and can expect minimal institutional help. An important area of reintegration is social relations. Teachers often pointed out that reintegration was more difficult for ‘introverted’ children than for the outgoing, ‘cool’ ones. This, we suspect, can easily be translated back to pre-existing middle-class dominant cultural and social capital, especially when it comes to being self-confide

AB  - Abstract Background Research has documented the impact of Alzheimer’s disease on critical driving skills (Adler, Rottunda, &amp; Dysken, 2005; Eby et al., 2012). Impairments in driving are likely to be similar reasons that hinder use of public transit or other modes of travel. Figure 1 illustrates examples where the warning signs of AD not only present challenges to driving but also may affect the use of transportation options. Figure 2 illustrates the continuum from driver to passenger. A framework for perceiving mobility as the outcome and driving as just one mode of travel can succeed in reducing the perception of loss to the individual if models of supportive transportation are more available in practice. Method Drawing on the Dementia Friendly Calculator (Figure 3), and Silverstein and Turk (2015) interviews with transportation providers, supportive transportation is operationalized in terms of the level of assistance needed and whether transportation providers deliver that assistance. Understanding the 5As of availability, affordability, adaptability, accessibility, and acceptability led to strategies and tips for transportation providers, drivers, care partners, and the person with dementia. Results Strategies include pre‐trip checklists, passenger information; escorts to provide to the door, through the door , or stay at the destination assistance; training on communication and sensitivity in providing assistance in/out of vehicle. Conclusion Expanding the availability of supportive transportation options will enable persons with dementia to engage in their communities safely and longer throughout the disease process.

AB  - Lower limb orthoses (LLOs) are often prescribed to facilitate mobility in individuals with functional impairments. The Orthotic Patient-Reported Outcomes – Mobility (OPRO-M) is a self-report instrument developed recently to measure LLO users’ perceived mobility with an orthosis. An observational, prospective, psychometric validation study was conducted to evaluate the construct validity and test-retest reliability of the OPRO-M 12- and 20-item short forms. LLO users were recruited from orthotic clinics across the United States. Participants were administered four self-report instruments (OPRO-M, Orthotic and Prosthetic Users Survey – Lower Extremity Functional Status, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Physical Function) and three performance-based instruments (10-meter Walk Test, Timed Up and Go Test, and Two-Minute Walk Test) during an in-person assessment. Self-report instruments were re-administered via an online survey sent to participants 7 days later. Convergent validity was assessed by comparing OPRO-M scores to those from co-administered self-report and performance-based instruments. Known groups validity was evaluated by comparing scores from patients grouped by clinician-assigned mobility level. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing scores from the in-person and follow-up assessments. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable change (SDC) were derived from test-retest reliability coefficients. A total of 104 LLO users (51% male, mean age = 53 years) completed both assessments. OPRO-M short form scores correlated strongly with those from self-report (ρ = 0.84–0.91) and performance-based (|ρ| = 0.73–0.83) instruments. OPRO-M short form scores also effectively differentiated all mobility groups except household and limited community ambulators. The OPRO-M short forms showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.93–0.94) and low measurement error (SEM = 2.4–2.6, SDC = 5.5–6.0). These results provide sound evidence of the OPRO-M short forms’ validity and reliability when used to measure mobility in LLO users. These instruments are promising, population-specific alternatives to generic surveys with psychometric performance comparable to or better than established self-report instruments.

AB  - <sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> In the field of pain, virtual reality (VR) technology has been increasingly common in the context of procedural pain management. As an interactive technology tool, VR has the potential to be extended beyond acute pain management to chronic pain rehabilitation with a focus on increasing engagement with painful or avoided movements. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> We outline the development and initial implementation of a VR program in pain rehabilitation intervention to enhance function in youth with chronic pain. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> We present the development, acceptability, feasibility, and utility of an innovative VR program (Fruity Feet) for pediatric pain rehabilitation to facilitate increased upper and lower extremity engagement. The development team was an interdisciplinary group of pediatric experts, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, pain psychologists, anesthesiologists, pain researchers, and a VR software developer. We used a 4-phase iterative development process that engaged clinicians, parents, and patients via interviews and standardized questionnaires. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> This study included 17 pediatric patients (13 female, 4 male) enrolled in an intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) program, with mean age of 13.24 (range 7-17) years, completing a total of 63 VR sessions. Overall reports of presence were high (mean 28.98; max 40; SD 4.02), suggestive of a high level of immersion. Among those with multisession data (n=8), reports of pain (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001), fear (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.003), avoidance (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.004), and functional limitations (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.01) significantly decreased. Qualitative analysis revealed (1) a positive experience with VR (eg, enjoyed VR, would like to utilize the VR program again, felt VR was a helpful tool); (2) feeling distracted from pain while engaged in VR; (3) greater perceived mobility; and (4) fewer clinician-observed pain behaviors during VR. Movement data support the targeted impact of the Fruity Feet compared to other available VR programs. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> The iterative development process yielded a highly engaging and feasible VR program based on qualitative feedback, questionnaires, and movement data. We discuss next steps for the refinement, implementation, and assessment of impact of VR on chronic pain rehabilitation. VR holds great promise as a tool to facilitate therapeutic gains in chronic pain rehabilitation in a manner that is highly reinforcing and fun. </sec>
